Description: Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix (development files)
 VDPAU (Video Decode and Presentation API for Unix) is an open source
 library (libvdpau) and API designed by NVIDIA originally for its GeForce
 8 series and later GPU hardware, targeted at the X Window System on Unix
 operating-systems (including Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris). This VDPAU API
 allows video programs to offload portions of the video decoding process
 and video post-processing to the GPU video-hardware.
 .
 This package contains the files necessary for development with VDPAU.
