Package: libros-rosgraph-msgs-dev
Section: libdevel
Architecture: all
Depends: ${misc:Depends}, libstd-msgs-dev
Description: Messages relating to the Robot OS Computation Graph
 This package is part of Robot OS (ROS). rosgraph_msgs contains
 messages relating to the ROS Computation Graph. Most users are not
 expected to interact with the messages in this package, and it is
 strongly advised against. These messages are generally wrapped in
 higher level APIs.
