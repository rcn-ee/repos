Description: Boost C++ Libraries development files
 The Boost web site provides free, peer-reviewed, portable C++ source
 libraries. The emphasis is on libraries which work well with the C++
 Standard Library. One goal is to establish "existing practice" and
 provide reference implementations so that the Boost libraries are
 suitable for eventual standardization. Some of the libraries have
 already been proposed for inclusion in the C++ Standards Committee's
 upcoming C++ Standard Library Technical Report.
 .
 This package provides headers for all Boost libraries.
 .
 Extended precision arithmetic package libmpfrc++-dev or libntl-dev is
 required to use the Boost.Multiprecision wrapping of the respective
 library.
 .
 For the following subprojects separate packages exist: chrono,
 date-time, exception filesystem, graph, iostreams, locale, math, mpi,
 program_options, python, regex, serialization, signals, system, test,
 thread, timer, and wave.

 Boost.Atomic is a library that provides atomic data types and
 operations on these data types, as well as memory ordering
 constraints required for coordinating multiple threads through atomic
 variables. It implements the interface as defined by the C++11
 standard, but makes this feature available for platforms lacking
 system/compiler support for this particular C++11 feature.
 .
 Users of this library should already be familiar with concurrency in
 general, as well as elementary concepts such as "mutual exclusion".

 The implementation makes use of processor-specific instructions where
 possible (via inline assembler, platform libraries or compiler
 intrinsics), and falls back to "emulating" atomic operations through
 locking.

Description: C++ representation of time duration, time point, and clocks
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Boost.Chrono library provides:
 .
  * A means to represent time durations: managed by the generic duration
    class.Examples of time durations include days, minutes, seconds and
    nanoseconds, which can be represented with a fixed number of clock
    ticks per unit. All of these units of time duration are united with
    a generic interface by the duration facility.
  * A type for representing points in time: time_point. A time_point
    represents an epoch plus or minus a duration. The library leaves
    epochs unspecified. A time_point is associated with a clock.
  * Several clocks, some of which may not be available on a particular
    platform: system_clock, steady_clock and high_resolution_clock. A
    clock is a pairing of a time_point and duration, and a function
    which returns a time_point representing now.
 .
 To make the timing facilities more generally useful, Boost.Chrono
 provides a number of clocks that are thin wrappers around the
 operating system's time APIs, thereby allowing the extraction of wall
 clock time, user CPU time, system CPU time spent by the process:
 .
  * process_real_cpu_clock, captures wall clock CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * process_user_cpu_clock, captures user-CPU time spent by the current
    process.
  * process_system_cpu_clock, captures system-CPU time spent by the
    current process.
  * a tuple-like class process_cpu_clock, that captures real, user-CPU,
    and system-CPU process times together.
  * a thread_clock thread steady clock giving the time spent by the
    current thread (when supported by a platform).
 .
 Lastly, Boost.Chrono includes typeof registration for duration and
 time_point to permit using emulated auto with C++03 compilers.

Description: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread

 Boost.Context is a foundational library that provides a sort of
 cooperative multitasking on a single thread. By providing an
 abstraction of the current execution state in the current thread,
 including the stack (with local variables) and stack pointer, all
 registers and CPU flags, and the instruction pointer, a fcontext_t
 instance represents a specific point in the application's execution
 path. This is useful for building higher-level abstractions, like
 coroutines, cooperative threads (userland threads) or an equivalent
 to C# keyword yield in C++.

Description: provides a sort of cooperative multitasking on a single thread
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 Boost.Coroutine provides templates for generalized subroutines which
 allow multiple entry points for suspending and resuming execution at
 certain locations. It preserves the local state of execution and
 allows re-entering subroutines more than once (useful if state must
 be kept across function calls).
 .
 Coroutines can be viewed as a language-level construct providing a
 special kind of control flow.
 .
 In contrast to threads, which are pre-emptive, coroutine switches are
 cooperative (programmer controls when a switch will happen). The
 kernel is not involved in the coroutine switches.
 .
 The implementation uses Boost.Context for context switching.

Description: C++ logging library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 This library aims to make logging significantly easier for the
 application developer. It provides a wide range of out-of-the-box
 tools along with public interfaces for extending the library. The
 main goals of the library are:
 .
  * Simplicity. A small example code snippet should be enough to get
 the feel of the library and be ready to use its basic features.
  * Extensibility. A user should be able to extend functionality of the
 library for collecting and storing information into logs.
  * Performance. The library should have as little performance impact on
 the user's application as possible.

 Python. The major features of Boost.Python include support for:

 numeric operators among others.

 Regular expressions are a form of pattern-matching that are often

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: C99/C++ preprocessor library
 This package forms part of the Boost C++ Libraries collection.
 .
 The Wave C++ preprocessor library is a Standards conformant
 implementation of the mandated C99/C++ preprocessor functionality
 packed behind a simple to use interface, which integrates well with
 the well known idioms of the Standard Template Library (STL).
