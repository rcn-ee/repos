RTnet rt2500 WLAN README
========================

See http://www.fsf.org/resources/hw/net/wireless/cards.html 
for a list of cards which use the rt2500 chipset.

After the modules rt_rt2x00core and rt_rt2500pci have been loaded the driver
can be configured with rtiwconfig. Following features are currently implemented
(see also rtiwconfig --help):

* bitrate: The committed value is multiplied with 0.5 Mbit/s.
    Valid is 2, 4, 11, 22 for 802.11b and
    12, 18, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 108 for 802.11g.

* channel: Sets frequency/channel. Channel IDs are from 1 to 13.

* txpower: Sets the transmission power. Zero means minimum TX power.

* retry: The hardware can be configured to do transmission retries.
    This sets the maximum amount of retries.

* tx mode: The RTnet driver can be used in three different modes:

    "raw": No acknowledgement of transmitted frames is expected.
           -> No retries possible.
           Target address of WLAN frame is set as passed from higher layers.

    "ack": Acknowledgement of every transmitted frames is expected.
           -> Retries are possible.
           Target address of WLAN frame is set as passed from higher layers.
           WARNING: This is currently only useful for unicast transmission.

    "mcast": No acknowledgement of the frame is expected.
           Receiver address of the WLAN frame is the own MAC-Address with group
           bit set.

* drop broadcast: Configures, whether the hardware shall drop received
    broadcast frames.

* drop multicast: Configures, whether the hardware shall drop received
    multicast frames.

* bbp sensibility: Sets the receiving sensibility of the base band processor.
    Values around 70 seem to be useful.

* autoresponder: Determines, whether the hardware responds automatically on
    received unicast frames with an ACK frame.

* regread/regwrite: Gives direct access to the chipset registers.
    Only useful if you know what you are doing :)

The driver has been tested with an ASUS WL-107g PCMCIA and a MSI PC54G2 PCI
card.

KNOWN BUGS: 
After configuring the bitrate via rtiwconfig the driver activates the
hardware autoresponder. If desired, the autoresponder has to be disabled again
manually.
