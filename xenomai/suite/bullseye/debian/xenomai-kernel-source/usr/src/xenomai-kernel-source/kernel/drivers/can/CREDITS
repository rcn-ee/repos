The RT-Socket-CAN project is based on the SJA1000 socket-based CAN 
driver for RTDM by Sebastian Smolorz [1]. Other parts are from the RTnet 
project [2], especially the device interface, the RTDM serial device 
driver and profile of Xenomai [3] and from other Open Source CAN driver 
projects like PCAN [4], the linux-can.patch [5] and Socket-CAN [6].
