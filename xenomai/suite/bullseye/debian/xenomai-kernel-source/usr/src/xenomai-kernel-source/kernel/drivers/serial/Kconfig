config XENO_DRIVERS_16550A_PIO
	bool "Port-based I/O"
	help
	Hardware access only via I/O ports. Use module parameter
	"io=<port>[,<port>[,...]]" to specify the base port of a device.

config XENO_DRIVERS_16550A_MMIO
	bool "Memory-mapped I/O"
	help
	Hardware access only via memory mapping. Use module paramter
	"mem=<addr>[,<addr>[,...]]" to specify the physical base address of
	a device.

config XENO_DRIVERS_16550A_ANY
	bool "Any access mode"
	help
	Decide at module load-time (or via kernel parameter) which access
	mode to use for which device. This mode is useful when devices of
	both types can be present in a system, also at the same time.

	Both "io" and "mem" module parameters are available, but always only
	one of them can be applied on a particular device. Use, e.g.,
	"io=0x3f8,0 mem=0,0xe0000000" to address device 1 via IO base port
	0x3f8 and device 2 via physical base address 0xe0000000.
