    The Real-Time Configuration service configures and monitors nodes in
    a RTnet network. It works both with plain MAC as well as with IPv4
    addresses (in case CONFIG_RTNET_RTIPV4 has been switched on). RTcfg
    consists of a configuration server, which can run on the same station
    as the TDMA master e.g., and one or more clients. Clients can join and
    leave the network during runtime without interfering with other
    stations. Besides network configuration, the RTcfg server can also
    distribute custom data.

    See Documentation/README.rtcfg for further information.

    default n
    ---help---

    you have to trace some problem related to RTcfg.
