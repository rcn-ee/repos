    The Real-Time Media Access Control layer allows to extend the RTnet
    stack with software-based access control mechanisms (also called
    disciplines) for nondeterministic transport media. Disciplines can be
    attached and detached per real-time device. RTmac also provides a
    framework for tunnelling non-time-critical packets through real-time
    networks by installing virtual NICs (VNIC) in the Linux domain.

    See Documentation/README.rtmac for further information.
