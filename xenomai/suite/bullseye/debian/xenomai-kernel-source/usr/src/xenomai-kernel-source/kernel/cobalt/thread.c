 * @brief Initialize a new thread.
 *
 * Initializes a new thread. The thread is left dormant until it is
 * actually started by xnthread_start().
 *
 * @param thread The address of a thread descriptor Cobalt will use to
 * store the thread-specific data.  This descriptor must always be
 * valid while the thread is active therefore it must be allocated in
 * permanent memory. @warning Some architectures may require the
 * descriptor to be properly aligned in memory; this is an additional
 * reason for descriptors not to be laid in the program stack where
 * alignement constraints might not always be satisfied.
 *
 * @param attr A pointer to an attribute block describing the initial
 * properties of the new thread. Members of this structure are defined
 * as follows:
 *
 * - name: An ASCII string standing for the symbolic name of the
 * thread. This name is copied to a safe place into the thread
 * descriptor. This name might be used in various situations by Cobalt
 * for issuing human-readable diagnostic messages, so it is usually a
 * good idea to provide a sensible value here.  NULL is fine though
 * and means "anonymous".
 *
 * - flags: A set of creation flags affecting the operation. The
 * following flags can be part of this bitmask:
 *
 *   - XNSUSP creates the thread in a suspended state. In such a case,
 * the thread shall be explicitly resumed using the xnthread_resume()
 * service for its execution to actually begin, additionally to
 * issuing xnthread_start() for it. This flag can also be specified
 * when invoking xnthread_start() as a starting mode.
 *
 * - XNUSER shall be set if @a thread will be mapped over an existing
 * user-space task. Otherwise, a new kernel host task is created, then
 * paired with the new Xenomai thread.
 *
 * - XNFPU (enable FPU) tells Cobalt that the new thread may use the
 * floating-point unit. XNFPU is implicitly assumed for user-space
 * threads even if not set in @a flags.
 *
 * - affinity: The processor affinity of this thread. Passing
 * CPU_MASK_ALL means "any cpu" from the allowed core affinity mask
 * (cobalt_cpu_affinity). Passing an empty set is invalid.
 *
 * @param sched_class The initial scheduling class the new thread
 * should be assigned to.
 *
 * @param sched_param The initial scheduling parameters to set for the
 * new thread; @a sched_param must be valid within the context of @a
 * sched_class.
 *
 * @return 0 is returned on success. Otherwise, the following error
 * code indicates the cause of the failure:
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if @a attr->flags has invalid bits set, or @a
 *   attr->affinity is invalid (e.g. empty).

 * affects several behaviours of the Cobalt core regarding this
 * thread.
 *
 * @param clrmask Clears the corresponding bits from the control mode
 * before setmask is applied. The scheduler lock held by the current
 * thread can be forcibly released by passing the XNLOCK bit in this
 * mask. In this case, the lock nesting count is also reset to zero.
 *
 * @param setmask The new thread mode. The following flags may be set
 * in this bitmask:
 *
 * - XNLOCK makes the current thread non-preemptible by other threads.
 * Unless XNTRAPLB is also set for the thread, the latter may still
 * block, dropping the lock temporarily, in which case, the lock will
 * be reacquired automatically when the thread resumes execution.
 *
 * - XNWARN enables debugging notifications for the current thread.  A
 * SIGDEBUG (Linux-originated) signal is sent when the following
 * atypical or abnormal behavior is detected:
 *
 *    - the current thread switches to secondary mode. Such notification
 *      comes in handy for detecting spurious relaxes.
 *
 *    - CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_MUTEX_RELAXED is enabled in the kernel
 *      configuration, and the current thread is sleeping on a Cobalt
 *      mutex currently owned by a thread running in secondary mode,
 *      which reveals a priority inversion.
 *
 *    - the current thread is about to sleep while holding a Cobalt
 *      mutex, and CONFIG_XENO_OPT_DEBUG_MUTEX_SLEEP is enabled in the
 *      kernel configuration. Blocking for acquiring a mutex does not
 *      trigger such a signal though.
 *
 *    - the current thread has both XNTRAPLB and XNLOCK set, and
 *      attempts to block on a Cobalt service, which would cause a
 *      lock break.
 *
 * - XNTRAPLB disallows breaking the scheduler lock. In the default
 * case, a thread which holds the scheduler lock is allowed to drop it
 * temporarily for sleeping. If this mode bit is set, such thread
 * would return immediately with XNBREAK set from
 * xnthread_suspend(). If XNWARN is set for the current thread,
 * SIGDEBUG is sent in addition to raising the break condition.
 *

 * @note Setting @a clrmask and @a setmask to zero leads to a nop,
 * in which case xnthread_set_mode() returns the current mode.

 *
 * Suspends the execution of a thread according to a given suspensive
 * condition. This thread will not be eligible for scheduling until it
 * all the pending suspensive conditions set by this service are
 * removed by one or more calls to xnthread_resume().
 *
 * @param thread The descriptor address of the suspended thread.
 *
 * @param mask The suspension mask specifying the suspensive condition
 * to add to the thread's wait mask. Possible values usable by the
 * caller are:
 *
 * - XNSUSP. This flag forcibly suspends a thread, regardless of any
 * resource to wait for. A reverse call to xnthread_resume()
 * specifying the XNSUSP bit must be issued to remove this condition,
 * which is cumulative with other suspension bits.@a wchan should be
 * NULL when using this suspending mode.
 *
 * - XNDELAY. This flags denotes a counted delay wait (in ticks) which
 * duration is defined by the value of the timeout parameter.
 *
 * - XNPEND. This flag denotes a wait for a synchronization object to
 * be signaled. The wchan argument must points to this object. A
 * timeout value can be passed to bound the wait. This suspending mode
 * should not be used directly by the client interface, but rather
 * through the xnsynch_sleep_on() call.
 *
 * @param timeout The timeout which may be used to limit the time the
 * thread pends on a resource. This value is a wait time given in
 * nanoseconds. It can either be relative, absolute monotonic, or
 * absolute adjustable depending on @a timeout_mode.
 *
 * Passing XN_INFINITE @b and setting @a timeout_mode to XN_RELATIVE
 * specifies an unbounded wait. All other values are used to
 * initialize a watchdog timer. If the current operation mode of the
 * system timer is oneshot and @a timeout elapses before
 * xnthread_suspend() has completed, then the target thread will not
 * be suspended, and this routine leads to a null effect.
 *
 * @param timeout_mode The mode of the @a timeout parameter. It can
 * either be set to XN_RELATIVE, XN_ABSOLUTE, or XN_REALTIME (see also
 * xntimer_start()).
 *
 * @param wchan The address of a pended resource. This parameter is
 * used internally by the synchronization object implementation code
 * to specify on which object the suspended thread pends. NULL is a
 * legitimate value when this parameter does not apply to the current
 * suspending mode (e.g. XNSUSP).
 *
 * @note If the target thread has received a Linux-originated signal,
 * then this service immediately exits without suspending the thread,
 * but raises the XNBREAK condition in its information mask.

 * @fn int xnthread_map(struct xnthread *thread, struct completion *done)
 * @internal
 * @brief Create a shadow thread context over a kernel task.
 *
 * This call maps a Cobalt core thread to the "current" Linux task
 * running in kernel space.  The priority and scheduling class of the
 * underlying Linux task are not affected; it is assumed that the
 * caller did set them appropriately before issuing the shadow mapping
 * request.
 *
 * This call immediately moves the calling kernel thread to the
 * Xenomai domain.
 *
 * @param thread The descriptor address of the new shadow thread to be
 * mapped to "current". This descriptor must have been previously
 * initialized by a call to xnthread_init().
 *
 * @param done A completion object to be signaled when @a thread is
 * fully mapped over the current Linux context, waiting for
 * xnthread_start().
 *
 * @return 0 is returned on success. Otherwise:
 *
 * - -ERESTARTSYS is returned if the current Linux task has received a
 * signal, thus preventing the final migration to the Xenomai domain
 * (i.e. in order to process the signal in the Linux domain). This
 * error should not be considered as fatal.
 *
 * - -EPERM is returned if the shadow thread has been killed before
 * the current task had a chance to return to the caller. In such a
 * case, the real-time mapping operation has failed globally, and no
 * Xenomai resource remains attached to it.
 *
 * - -EINVAL is returned if the thread control block bears the XNUSER
 * bit.
 *
 * - -EBUSY is returned if either the current Linux task or the
 * associated shadow thread is already involved in a shadow mapping.

 * @coretags{secondary-only, might-switch}
