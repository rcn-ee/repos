# The package libxenomai1 first didn't contain a library called *xenomai*.
# Therefore, I called it libxenomai1. Now, upstream introduced libxenomai0 in
# the package.  I'm leaving the package name libxenomai1 for now since
# downgrading the number in the package name is probably a bad idea, and
# synchronizing the package name with the SO version number isn't easily
# possible anyway since the package contains several libraries.
