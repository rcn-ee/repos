    - reorder the patches: put the ones accepted upstream below

    timeskew while building the packages (and Closes: #466360).
  * debian/deb3: Remove QUILT_PATCH_OPTS=--reject-format=unified as it

quilt (0.60-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * debian/control: specify the encoding to emacs at the file bottom,
    not the file top (Closes: #689554).
    This should help clumsy tools that get fooled when the control
    file begins with an empty paragraph, even if they should not break.
  * debian/control: Recommends less, as we use it in most commands
    (probably all but the raw push/pop ones). (LP: #1089601)
  * Add deb3 script to convert debian source package to new 3.0
    (quilt) format. Thanks to Osamu Aoki for that (Closes: #581186).
  * d/p/dep3mail: Allow mail subcommand to get the mail subject
    from dep3-formated patches, so that I can use it to report
    the changes done to quilt itself to my own upstream.
  * d/p/doc_search_of_patches: Document the fact that quilt searches
    for its `patches' directory in the same way that git searches for
    its configuration (Closes: #549482).
  * d/p/doc_exit_status: Document the exit status (Closes: #587001).

  * Drop patch fix-manpage-generation, merged upstream.
  * Drop patch debianize, instead pass --with-docdir=/usr/share/doc/quilt to

    is not compressed.
  * Drop unused patch no-QUILT_LIB-in-quilt.
  * New patch ensure-manpage-has-correct-patches-dir to fix the default
    patches directory documented in quilt(1). Closes: #585438

  * Drop entirely debian/patches/testsuite_cleanups since it's no longer
    needed.
  * Integrate 2 small regression fixes from upstream in
    debian/patches/backport-fixes-from-0.50, we could have waited 0.51
    for Debian but this offers a chance to get them in Ubuntu's LTS 12.04.

  * Drop patch po-fix-msguniq which added an invocation to msguniq to
    the po files regeneration. Nothing similar is done in the packages
    I checked, and msgmerge seem to be reasonable nowadays.
  * add configure option --with-awk=/usr/bin/awk to avoid that
    configure finds locally installed gawk (don't explicit dependent
    on awk since it's essential)                          Closes: #637014

  * Refresh all other patches.
  * Disable patch debian/patches/testsuite_cleanups as it creates more
    problems than it seems to solve.
  * Drop lintian override file, the only override needed has been fixed
    upstream (by dropping the useless shebang).
  * Add missing ${perl:Depends} to the Depends field.
  * Switch to debhelper compat level 8.
  * Switch away from CDBS to dh.
  * Ensure we can build twice in a row by resetting properly the
    regenerated po/*.{po,pot} files.

  * Update documentation of dh_quilt_{,un}patch to use the
    correct dh command-line syntax (thanks to Michael Ole Olsen for the
    report!) and add a note saying that those tools are useless with the "3.0

  * Update watch file to not hardcode a specific savannah mirror.
  * Add a lintian overrides for script-not-executable
    ./usr/share/quilt/scripts/patchfns, it's a shell library with a
    useless shebang.
  * Update debian/patches/use-sensible-editor to unset VISUAL

quilt (0.48-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * The new algorithm that makes quilt lookup parent directories for
    .pc/.quilt_{patches,series} lead to the failure of test/setup.test
    when run in the Debian source package since $QUILT_PATCHES points
    to debian/patches when the test script expect it to be "patches".
    Avoid this by forcing QUILT_PATCHES in the test script (patch
    debian/patches/fix-test-setup) but suggest upstream to hardcode locations
    in quilt setup. Closes: #573689
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.4 (no changes needed).

    Closes: #464663 (sample script for dpatch -> quilt conversions)
  * Pass --no-print-directory to make while generating the man page to
    counter the fact that the top-level make (ie, debian/rules) pass
    -w to all childs. Patch by Romain Francoise, thanks.
    Closes: #436936 (build process has contaminated the manpage)

  [ Raphael Hertzog ]
  * Add myself to Uploaders.
  * Update Standards-Version to 3.8.0:
    - support patch/unpatch rules in patchsys-quilt.mk
    - support patch/unpatch rules in debian/rules
  * Switch to debhelper 5, adjust debian/compat and build-depends.
  * Remove minimal version in the cdbs build-dependency, even oldstable
    has a high-enough version.
  * patchsys-quilt.mk: don't try to apply patches in $(DEB_SRCDIR) but in
    current directory. This is best for compatibility with the upcoming "3.0
    (quilt)" source package format and the two only packages which are
    affected by this change have already been fixed (see #485142, #485163).
    Closes: #485835

quilt (0.46-4.1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Non-maintainer upload.
  * Changes in patchsys-quilt.mk:
    * Convert to UTF-8.
    * Always use QUILT_PATCHES=$(CURDIR)/debian/patches. And thus drop the
      creation of the "patches" symlink as it will occasionnaly lead to
      problems with some packages. Closes: #473381
    * Fixes generated build-dependency on CDBS to not contain the "-1" that
      leads to the lintian warning "build-depends-on-1-revision".
      Closes: #482948
  * Fixes "apply-patches" rule to not reapply patches when they have already
    been applied by dpkg-source. Closes: #482750
  * Integrate debian/README.source as suggested by Russ Allbery and install it
    in /usr/share/doc/quilt/. Closes: #478421
  * Several lintian fixes:
    * clean-should-be-satisfied-by-build-depends: move debhelper and cdbs to
      Build-Depends
    * doc-base-file-uses-obsolete-national-encoding: switch
      debian/quilt.doc-base to UTF-8.
    * virtual-package-depends-without-real-package-depends and
      needlessly-depends-on-awk: drop dependency and build-dependency on awk.
    * spelling-error-in-description linux Linux: fix description accordingly.
    * doc-base-unknown-section: switch doc-base section to "Programming".
    * doc-base-abstract-might-contain-extra-leading-whitespaces: fix doc-base
      description to be a proper paragraph that can be rewrapped.

    Makefile, but from the makefile I use to rebuild the package here.

quilt (0.46-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Integrate the changes to the quilt package from Simon Horman.
    Add Simon to the uploaders list. Changes to the different patches:

    [arch_all] (modified)
      - stop exporting QUILT_LIB in bin/quilt since there is no lib after the
        arch_all modification
      - remove the backup-files.c since we don't use it anymore

    [mail-signature] (new)
      new option --signature to the mail command to specify which signature
      file to use (defaults to ~/.signature)

    [no-signature-test] (new)
      forbid the use of a .signature file in the tests (using the feature of
      previous patch) to not fail when a ~/.signature is present

    [mail-from-locale] (new)
      Force locale to C when generating date for From header

  * [debian/quilt.make]: various fixes

      likewise for debian/patchsys-quilt.mk. (Closes: #418680)
      By Peter Eisentraut.
    - Add ".PHONY: patch unpatch" as it should be. (Closes: #405558)
      By Steinar H. Gunderson.
    - Place emacs mode on the first line. (Closes: #406249)

    By Loïc Minier. (Closes: #406183)

  * [patches/doc_improvements] catch punctuation typos. (Closes: #402120)
    By Bastian Kleineidam.

  * [patches/makefile_gliches] Yet another try to remove debuging output
    form the makefile. By Bastian Kleineidam. (Closes: #402114)

  * Suggest the graphviz package since the graph command use it (at least
    the 'dot' command of graphviz). (Closes: #407469).
  * Change Build-deps into Build-dep-indep since we're now arch:all

    Note that if nocheck is added to DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS, the package will be
     built since there will be no test to fail. The only pb is that I can't
     remember of how to add this option with dpkg-buildpackage ;)

    is what I understand from the Right Thing to do.
  * Pass --quiltrc /dev/null to quilt in /usr/share/quilt/quilt.make for
    those who don't use cdbs but still don't want to FTBFTS because of
    personal settings in ~/.quiltrc. Closes: #370041.

quilt (0.39-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. 
    0.38 were mostly bugfixes, and those bugs were also reported against
      debian package, so I had to steal most of the cvs content already.
    0.39 is also mainly bugfixes. There is a new "mail" command I didn't

  * Refuse to add symlinks into patches since we fail to backup them
    properly. (Closes: #294424). Will be in 0.40 ;)

    Cdbs updates them automatically. Thanks to Robert Millan for detecting
    the issue (in cdbs) and proposing a fix (in quilt). (Closes: #295913).
    
    This implies a versionned depend on cdbs (>=0.4.27-1) for using packages,

    - documentation update.
