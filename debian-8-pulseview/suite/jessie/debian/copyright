Upstream-Name: pulseview
Upstream-Contact: <sigrok-devel@lists.sourceforge.net>
Source: http://sigrok.org/wiki/PulseView
Comment:
 While most of the PulseView source files are GPLv2+ licensed, it has to be
 linked against at least libsigrok (which is GPLv3+) & usually also against
 libsigrokdecode (also GPLv3+), thus making PulseView as a whole GPLv3+.
