    (Salsa MR !2; add dependency on e2fsprogs for chattr.)
  * Touch swapfile before trying to set the CoW attribute. (MR !3)

dphys-swapfile (20100506-6) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Drop fallocate.patch: swapon(8) states that fallocate-generated
    swapfiles will not work on certain file systems and explicitly
    recommends the use of dd as upstream does. (Closes: #913481)
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.4.0. (No changes needed.)
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 12.
    + Replace debian/compat with a versioned b-d on debhelper-compat.
  * Add "Pre-Depends: ${misc:Pre-Depends}" to be able to use "invoke-rc.d
    --skip-systemd-native". Thanks Lintian!

dphys-swapfile (20100506-5) unstable; urgency=high

  * Add patch to fix the setup subcommand exiting prematurely with more
    recent dc versions. (Closes: #906767, LP: #1788681) Also update
    check-diskspace-first.patch which uses the same syntax. Thanks to
    eHenry Berg for the initial bug report, Davide Prina for additional
    debugging help, and Wladimir Mutel for finding the actual culprit.

dphys-swapfile (20100506-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add patch to restrict swap file size to (configurable) 50% of the
    remaining disk space (excluding potentially already existing
    dphys-swapfile swap files). (Closes: #596187)
  * Declare compliance with Debian Policy 4.2.0.
    + Use HTTPS for the debian copyright format URL.
    + Replace /var/run/ in CONF_SWAPFILE example in man page with nowadays
      more realistic /var/tmp/.
  * Update Vcs-* headers for move to Salsa.
  * Bump debhelper compatibility level to 11.
    + Update versioned build-dependency on debhelper accordingly.
  * Add a systemd .service file. (Closes: #857861)
    + Thanks to Christian Göttsche for the service file template.
    + Should also fix issues where systemd kills the init script when
      dphys-swapfile takes long to setup the swap file, e.g. due to slow
      SD cards, since with "Type=oneshot" that timeout is disabled.
      (LP: #1496216)
  * Set "Rules-Requires-Root: no".
  * Update copyright years in debian/copyright.
  * Add a DEP12 debian/upstream/metadata file.

dphys-swapfile (20100506-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Add versioned dependency on lsb-base for using /lib/lsb/init-functions
    in the init script.
  * Add patch to first call chmod, then mkswap. This avoids a mkswap
    warning about insecure permissions, suggesting the permissions the
    file will be set to anyways afterwards.
  * Add patch by basti to use fallocate if available to create the swap
    file much faster than with dd.

dphys-swapfile (20100506-2) unstable; urgency=medium

    + Convert to machine-readable DEP5 format.
    + Update copyright years.
    + Update upstream author's e-mail address.
    + Update initial packager's last name.
    + Fix download URL (dphys-config vs dphys-swapfile; follow redirect)
  * Long package description: Add a paragraph about usefulness with
    provisioned SD card, USB stick and disk images.
  * Add debian/maintscript to help migration from /etc/bash_completion.d/
    to /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/.

    - uses dc instead of expr, so depend on dc
