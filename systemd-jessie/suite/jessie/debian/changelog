  * Disable default DNS servers in systemd-resolved. In v215 they are always
    added to resolv.conf as fallback entries even when DNS servers were
    acquired from systemd-networkd. (Closes: #787731)
  * Use strictly versioned dependendency on libsystemd-dev for the
    transitional dev packages. The .pc files of the compat libraries declare
    a strictly versioned dependency on libsystemd.pc, so reflect that in the
    package dependencies as well. (Closes: #794290)
  * udev: Increase udev event timeout to 180s. Some kernel modules, like
    mptsas, can take longer then 30s to load so udevd kills the (hanging)
    worker responsible for loading the module. Increase timeout from 30s to
    180s to workaround this issue. Thanks Faidon Liambotis.

  * Update insserv-generator and map $x-display-manager to
    display-manager.service, following the recent change in sysv-generator.

  * Add preinst check to abort udev upgrade if the currently running kernel
    lacks devtmpfs support. Since udev 176, devtmpfs is mandatory as udev no
    longer creates any device nodes itself. This only affects self-compiled
    kernels which now need CONFIG_DEVTMPFS=y.  Closes: #722580
  * Fix SysV init script to correctly mount a devtmpfs instead of tmpfs. This
    only affects users without an initramfs, which usually is responsible for
    mounting the devtmpfs.  Closes: #722604
  * Drop pre-squeeze upgrade code from maintainer scripts and simplify the
    various upgrade checks.
  * Suppress errors about unknown hwdb builtin. udev 196 introduced a new
    "hwdb" builtin which is not understood by the old udev daemon.
  * Add missing udeb line to shlibs.local. This ensures that udev-udeb gets a
    proper dependency on libudev1-udeb and not libudev1.  Closes: #722939
  * Remove udev-udeb dependency from libudev1-udeb to avoid a circular
    dependency between the two packages. This dependency was copied over from
    the old udev-gtk-udeb package and no longer makes any sense since
    libudev1-udeb only contains a library nowadays.

  * New upstream release.  Closes: #675175, #675177
    - In v183 the udev sources have been merged into the systemd source tree.
      As a result, the udev binary packages will now be built from the systemd
      source package. To align the version numbers 139 releases were skipped.
    - For a complete list of changes, please refer to the NEWS file.
  * Add Marco to Uploaders.
  * Drop Suggests on the various python packages from systemd. The
    systemd-analyze tool has been reimplemented in C.
  * Add binary packages as found in the udev 175-7.2 source package.
  * Wrap dependencies for better readability.
  * Drop hard-coded Depends on libglib2.0-0 from gir1.2-gudev-1.0.
  * Drop old Conflicts, Replaces and Breaks, which are no longer necessary.
  * Make libgudev-1.0-dev depend on gir1.2-gudev-1.0 as per GObject
    introspection mini-policy.  Closes: #691313
  * The hwdb builtin has replaced pci-db and usb-db in udev. Drop the
    Recommends on pciutils and usbutils accordingly.
  * Drop our faketime hack. Upstream uses a custom xsl style sheet now to
    generate the man pages which no longer embeds the build date.
  * Add Depends on libpam-runtime (>= 1.0.1-6) to libpam-systemd as we are
    using pam-auth-update.
  * Explicitly set Section and Priority for the udev binary package.
  * Update Build-Depends:
    - Drop libudev-dev, no longer required.
    - Add gtk-doc-tools and libglib2.0-doc for the API documentation in
      libudev and libgudev.
    - Add libgirepository1.0-dev and gobject-introspection for GObject
      introspection support in libgudev.
    - Add libgcrypt11-dev for encryption support in the journal.
    - Add libblkid-dev for the blkid udev builtin.
  * Use gir dh addon to ensure ${gir:Depends} is properly set.
  * Rename libudev0 → libudev1 for the SONAME bump.
  * Update symbols files. libudev now uses symbols versioning as the other
    libsystemd libraries. The libgudev-1.0-0 symbols file has been copied from
    the old udev package.
  * Run gtkdocize on autoreconf.
  * Enable python bindings for the systemd libraries and ship them in a new
    package named python-systemd.
  * Tighten Depends on libsystemd-id128-dev for libsystemd-journal-dev as per
    libsystemd-journal.pc.
  * Remove obsolete bash-completion scripts on upgrades. Nowadays they are
    installed in /usr/share/bash-completion/completions.
  * Rename conffiles for logind and journald.
  * Rename udev-gtk-udeb → libudev1-udeb to better reflect its actual contents.
  * Build two flavours: a regular build and one for the udev udebs with
    reduced features/dependencies.
  * Create a few compat symlinks for the udev package, most notably
    /sbin/udevadm and /sbin/udevd.
  * Remove the dpkg-triggered debian-enable-units script. This was a temporary
    workaround for wheezy. Packages should use dh-systemd now to properly
    integrate service files with systemd.
  * Update debian/copyright using the machine-readable copyright format 1.0.
  * Integrate changes from udev 175-7 and acknowledge the 175-7.1 and 175-7.2
    non-maintainer uploads.
  * Keep the old persistent network interface naming scheme for now and make
    the new one opt-in via net.ifnames=1 on the kernel command line.
  * Drop the obsolete udev-mtab SysV init script and properly clean up on
    upgrades.
  * Simplify the udev SysV init script and remove experimental and obsolete
    features.
  * Revert upstream commits which dropped support for distro specific
    features and config files.
  * Make logind, hostnamed, localed and timedated D-Bus activatable and
    usable when systemd is not running.
  * Store hwdb binary database in /lib/udev, not /etc/udev. Create the file on
    install and upgrades.
  * Provide a dpkg file trigger for hwdb, so the database is automatically
    updated when packages install files into /lib/udev/hwdb.d.

systemd (19-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release
  * Add systemd-tmpfiles to systemd package.
  * Add ifup@.service for handling hotplugged interfaces from
    udev.  Closes: #610871
  * Mask mtab.service and udev-mtab.service as they are pointless when
    /etc/mtab is a symlink to /proc/mounts
  * Add breaks on lvm2 (<< 2.02.84-1) since older versions have udev rules
    that don't work well with systemd causing delays on bootup.

systemd (16-1) experimental; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream release.  Closes: #609611
  * Get rid of now obsolete patches that are upstream.
  * Use the built-in cryptsetup support in systemd, build-depend on
    libcryptsetup-dev (>= 2:1.2.0-1) to get a libcryptsetup in /lib.
  * Don't use systemctl redirect for init scripts with X-Interactive: true

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Update package description
  * Use v8 debhelper syntax
  * Make single-user mode work
  * Run hwclock-save.service on shutdown
  * Remove dependencies on legacy sysv mount scripts, as we use native
    mounting.

systemd (15-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Tollef Fog Heen ]
  * New upstream version, thanks a lot to Michael Biebl for help with
    preparing this version.
    - This version handles cycle breaking better.  Closes: #609225
  * Add libaudit-dev to build-depends
  * /usr/share/systemd/session has been renamed to /usr/share/systemd/user
    upstream, adjust build system accordingly.
  * Remove -s from getty serial console invocation.
  * Add dependency on new util-linux to make sure /sbin/agetty exists
  * Don't mount /var/lock with gid=lock (Debian has no such group).
  * Document problem with ifupdown's /etc/network/run being a normal
    directory.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Revert upstream change which requires libnotify 0.7 (not yet available in
    Debian).
  * Use dh-autoreconf for updating the build system.
  * Revert upstream commit which uses fsck -l (needs a newer version of
    util-linux).
  * Explicitly disable cryptsetup support to not accidentally pick up a
    libcryptsetup dependency in a tainted build environment, as the library
    is currently installed in /usr/lib.
  * Remove autogenerated man pages and vala C sources, so they are rebuilt.
  * Use native systemd mount support:
    - Use MountAuto=yes and SwapAuto=yes (default) in system.conf
    - Mask SysV init mount, check and cleanup scripts.
    - Create an alias (symlink) for checkroot (→ remount-rootfs.service) as
      synchronization point for SysV init scripts.
  * Mask x11-common, rmnologin, hostname, bootmisc and bootlogd.
  * Create an alias for procps (→ systemd-sysctl.service) and
    urandom (→ systemd-random-seed-load.service).
  * Create an alias for module-init-tools (→ systemd-modules-load.service) and
    a symlink from /etc/modules-load.d/modules.conf → /etc/modules.
  * Install lsb-base hook which redirects calls to SysV init scripts to
    systemctl: /etc/init.d/<foo> <action> → systemctl <action> <foo.service>
  * Install a (auto)mount unit to mount /lib/init/rw early during boot.

  * Add missing #DEBHELPER# token to libpam-systemd
  * Stop messing with runlevel5/multi-user.target symlink, this is handled
    correctly upstream.

  * Ship password agent
  * Clean up cgroups properly on upgrades, thanks to Michael Biebl for the
    patch.  Closes: #599577
