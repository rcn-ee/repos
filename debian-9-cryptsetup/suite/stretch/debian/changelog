cryptsetup (2:1.7.3-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * debian/scripts/decrypt_ssl: fix script to actually output the decrypted
    key. Apparently this script has been broken since June 2008. Doesn't seem
    like anybody is using it. Thanks to g1 for spotting and reporting the
    error. (Closes: #844050)
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-script:
    + limit the sleep after max passphrase attempts to devices for the rootfs.
      This mitigates the negative impact in case of broken keyscripts etc.
    + add $crypttarget to each message to provide more context.
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-hook: fix sanity check for key files on root
    fs in get_device_opts(): detect if processed device is a root (parent)
    device even for LVM setups. (closes: #842951)
  * debian/README.initramfs: minor fix to the decrypt_derived keyscript
    section: now that systemd is standard, 'cryptdisks_start' should be used
    instead of '/etc/init.d/cryptdisks start'.
  * debian/manpages/crypttab.xml: add a warning to the 'keyscript' option
    that systemd doesn't support the option (yet) and mention the possible
    workaround to process the devices in question in the initramfs.

  [ Guilhem Moulin ]
  * add debian/gbp.conf to set the upstream tag to "v%(version%.%_)s".  As
    this enables git-buildpackage >= 0.8.7 to automatically generate
    orig.tar.gz, step nr. 5 is now removed from debian/README.source.
  * debian/compat: bump debhelper compatibility version to 9.
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-hook:
    + fix tab damage for consistency with the rest of the code
    + better warning for deprecated settings
    + fix sanity check for key files in get_device_opts(): print a warning if
      the key file isn't on the root FS, or if the root device is not
      encrypted, even for LVM setups.
    + fix sanity check for key files in get_device_opts(): print a warning if
      the processed device is a resume device, even for LVM setups.
    + fix runtime error in get_lvm_deps() if the first argument is either
      missing or the empty string.
    + reset IFS after processing $rootopts in get_device_opts(); the missing
      linefeed in $IFS caused LVM logical volumes spaning over multiple PVs
      not to have their parent devices detected correctly.

cryptsetup (2:1.7.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * new upstream release 1.7.2. Highlights include:
    - code now uses kernel crypto API backend according to new changes
      introduced in mainline kernel. (in 1.7.1)
    - cryptsetup now allows special "-" (standard input) keyfile handling
      even for TCRYPT (TrueCrypt and VeraCrypt compatible) devices. (in 1.7.1)
    - Support activation options for error handling modes in Linux kernel
      dm-verity module. (in 1.7.2)
  * debian/cryptdisks.functions: use '--key-file=-' again with the tcrypt
    extension, now that upstream issue #269 is fixed.
  * migrate the packaging repository from SVN to Git:
    - debian/control: Update Vcs-* fields to point to the new git repository.
    - debian/README.source: document new repository structure and release
      handling.
  * debian/README.Debian, debian/NEWS: minor typo fixes.
  * debian/rules: run pod2man --release="$(DEB_VERSION). (Closes: #839352)

  [ Guilhem Moulin ]
  * debian/control: add self to uploaders.
  * debian/cryptdisks.functions: when iterating through the crypttab, don't
    abort after the first disk that fails to be closed.  Regression introduced
    2:1.7.0-1 when the filed is sourced under 'set -e'.
  * debian/cryptdisks.functions: stop using `seq` since cryptsetup doesn't
    depend on busybox.  Instead, try again after 1, 2, 4, 8 and 16s when an
    encrypted disk cannot be closed. (Closes: #811456)
  * debian/cryptsetup.maintscript: add a "rm_conffile" directive to remove
    conffile /etc/bash_completion.d/cryptdisks, obsolete since 2:1.7.0-1.
    (Closes: #810227)
  * debian/README.initramfs: fix typo s/initramfs-update/update-initramfs/.
    Thanks, Stuart Prescott. (Closes: #827263)
  * debian/rules: Add 'hardening=+pie' to DEB_BUILD_MAINT_OPTIONS to compile
    ELF executables as PIEs.
  * debian/control: Bump Standards-Version to 3.9.8 (no changes necessary).
  * debian/cryptsetup.lintian-overrides: Remove unused lintian override
    init.d-script-does-not-source-init-functions.
  * Use /etc/crytsetup-initramfs/conf-hook for initramfs hook script
    configuration.  For backward compatibility setting CRYPTSETUP and
    KEYFILE_PATTERN in /etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf is still supported
    for now, but causes the hook to print a warning.
    This is done following the initramfs-tools maintainers' request (see
    #807527) that hook and boot script configuration files be stored outside
    the /etc/initramfs-tools directory. (Closes: #783393)
  * Print a warning when private key material is to be included in the
    initramfs image (ie, if $KEYFILE_PATTERN is not empty), and the image is
    created with a permissive mode.
  * Add Indonesian debconf templates translation.  Thanks, Izharul Haq for the
    patch. (Closes: #835158)
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-hook: Avoid leading space in $rootdevs,
    $resumedevs, etc.
  * Support unlocking devices at initramfs stage using a key file stored on
    the encrypted root FS.  Note however that resume devices won't be unlocked
    this way since the resume boot script is currently run before mounting the
    root FS. (Closes: #776409)
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-hook: Avoid undesired effects for target or
    device names containing non-alphanumeric characters such as "." or "-":
    + replace `grep "^$x\b"` by `awk -vx="$x" '$1==x {print}'`; and
    + replace `echo "$x"` by printf '%s' "$x" when the argument might start
      with a dash.
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-{hook,script}, debian/cryptdisks.functions:
    ensure slash characters "/" from device labels are escaped when
    constructing symlinks under /dev/disk/by-label.
  * debian/scripts/decrypt_gnupg:
    + Remove --no-mdc-warning to display a warning if the MDC integrity
      protection is missing.
    + Replace "GnuPG key" by "gpg-encrypted key" in messages and
      documentation.
  * debian/initramfs/cryptgnupg-hook: Add support for multiple devices
    encrypted using a gpg-encrypted key.
  * debian/README.gnupg: Indicate that not the only the gpg-encrypted key for
    the root FS is copied onto the initramfs, but also the ones for all
    devices that need to be unlocked at initramfs stage.
  * debian/initramfs/cryptroot-hook: Fix bug for device label starting with
    "UUID=".

  [ Milan Broz ]
  * new upstream version. (closes: #704827, 707997)
    - default LUKS encryption mode is XTS (aes-xts-plain64) (closes: #714331)
    - adds native support for Truecrypt and compatible on-disk format
    - adds benchmark command
    - adds cryptsetup-reencrypt, a tool to offline reencrypt LUKS device
    - adds veritysetup, a tool for dm-verity block device verification module
  * install docs/examples into docs at cryptsetup-dev package.
  * fix compilation warnings in askpass.c.

  [ Steve Langasek ]
  * fix upstart jobs to not cause boot hangs when actually used in
    conjunction with startpar.  (closes: #694499, #677712).
  * in connection with the above, make the cryptdisks-early job explicitly
    wait for 'umountfs' on shutdown just like cryptdisks does; otherwise,

      since mounting on /tmp a) is racy, b) confuses mountall something fierce.
      LP: #475936.
  * fix manpage checkscripts documentation. clarify that both cryptdisks and
    cryptroot invoke checkscripts. thanks Christoph Anton Mitterer.
  * remove quotes from $KEYSCRIPT invokation, thanks Alexandre Rossi.
    (closes: #585099)
  * fix support for commandline options to mkfs in luksformat. thanks to Eduard
    Bloch again for bugreport and patch. (closes: #585787)
  * remove duplicates from debian/NEWS, thanks Steve Langasek (closes: 586019)
  * improve documentation on environment variables in cryptdisks.default and
    crypttab manpage. thanks Christoph Anton Mitterer. (closes: #585664)
  * several improvements to (pre)check scripts, inspired by scripts from
    Christoph Anton Mitterer (closes: #585418, #585496)
    - checkscripts exit with error 1 if executables aren't available.
    - ext2, swap and xfs scripts are depreciated and invoke blkid script.
    - drop filtering of minix filesystem in blkid, util-linux 2.17.2 in debian
    - remove *vol_id check scripts, vol_id isn't available in debian any longer
    - don't use sed in *blkid check scripts any longer
  * fix initramfs/cryptroot-hook to canonicalize $device in get_resume_devices
    function. this should really weed out all duplicates. (closes: #586122),
    and catch all udev/device-mapper symlink setups as well (closes: #554506)
  * bash-completion file now in pck bash-completion (closes: #586299, #586162)
  * add a paragraph about the boot order of init scripts to README.Debian,
    describing the current catch-22 situation. (closes: #576646)
  * initscripts and cryptdisks_st* no longer silently quit in case that include
    file /lib/cryptsetup/cryptdisks.functions is missing. (closes: #587220)
  * fix cryptdisks-early LSB headers to restore legacy boot sequence order.
    mdadm-raid was started before cryptdisks-early. (closes: #587224)
  * cryptdisks initscript now raises a warning for failed started devices, and
    cryptdisks-early initscript raises a warning for failed stopped devices.
    this makes the initscript actions far more transparent to users. same holds
    for cryptdisks_st*. thanks to Christoph Anton Mitterer. (closes: #587222)
  * remove lintian overrides init.d-script-should-depend-on-virtual-facility
    as lintian lintian 2.4.2 has fixed #580082.
  * bump standards-version to 3.9.0, remove version information from replaces/
    provides/conflicts against cryptsetup-luks, change conflicts against
    hashalot (<= 0.3-1) to breaks hashalot (<< 0.3-1) and add replaces.
  * fix loads of typos, thanks to Christoph Anton Mitterer. (closes: #588068)
  * update copyright years and list Milan Broz in debian/copyright

  * add 04_no_stderr_success.patch, which adds an option to suppress success
    messages to stderr. don't apply the patch as this already has been fixed
    upstream in another way. next cryptsetup release will print the command
    successful message to stdout only if opt_verbose is set.
  * add checkscripts blkid and un_blkid for the reason that vol_id will be
    removed from udev soon. advertise the new scripts at all places that
    mentioned vol_id or un_vol_id before.

    than expected. (closes: #488271)
  * execute udev_settle before $cryptremove if $cryptcreate fails at
    setup_mapping() in the initramfs cryptroot script. it seems like a short

    - check for exit code of handle_crypttab_line_{start<stop} in
      cryptdisks_{start|stop}, exit with proper status code (closes: #524173)
  * add a counter to the while loop in cryptdisks_{start|stop}, in order to
    detect if $dst was not found in crypttab. (closes: #524485)
  * check for keyscript in the new location in initramfs/cryptopensc-hook.
  * add README.opensc to docs, thanks to Benjamin Kiessling for writing it.

  * add patches/03_rework_read.patch [rework write_blockwise() and
    read_blockwise()], but don't apply it yet as it's still experimental.
    applying it will increase the speed of luksOpen.

  [ David Härdeman ]
  * Make sure $IGNORE is reset as necessary, patch by Thomas Luzat
    <thomas@luzat.com> (closes: #490199)
  * Use askpass in init scripts as well (closes: #489033, #477203)

  [ Jonas Meurer ]
  * Don't copy_exec libgcc1 in cryptopensc initramfs hook, as it's already
    copied by copy_exec /usr/sbin/pcscd automaticly. Thanks to Evgeni Golov
    <sargentd@die-welt.net>. (closes: #490300)
  * Remove the udev rules file again as the relevant rules are now provided
    by dmsetup package which cryptsetup depends on.
  * Add splashy support to askpass, thanks to John Hughes <john@calva.com>
    for the patch. (closes: #492451) The support is limited to cryptroot
    though, as splashy freezes for passphrase input dialogs from initscripts.
    Document that in README.Debian.
  * Now that askpass is used as keyscript for interactive mode, it's not
    necessary to set cryptsetup parameter '--tries=$TRIES' and TRIES=1 for
    interactive mode anymore in cryptdisks.functions.
  * Implement special treatment for random passphrases now that we use
    "--key-file=-" for all situations. Only necessary in do_noluks.
  * Fix the passphrase prompt string in initramfs/cryptroot.script to use
    $cryptsource instead of $cryptsources.
  * Major documentation cleanup for lenny:
    - Rewrite CryptoSwap.HowTo in README.Debian, remove CryptoSwap.HowTo.
    - Refer to README.initramfs instead of CryptoRoot.HowTo for encrypted root
      filesystem in README.Debian.
    - Remove outdated docs CryptoRoot.HowTo, usbcrypto.udev and gen-old-ssl-key
      as well as the decrypt_old_ssl keyscript.
    - Remove debian/TODO, didn't have any useful content anyway.
    - Fix section ''9. The "decrypt_derived" keyscript'': Add swap option to
      the example line for crypttab and other minor fixes. Thanks to
      Helmut Grohne <helmut@subdivi.de>. (closes: #491867)

  [ David Härdeman ]
  * Misc bugfixes to askpass, make sure it is installed to the correct
    location and is built using pedantic mode.
  * Change the initramfs script to use askpass to prompt for

    is enabled in the init scripts as well.
  * Add a keyscript called passdev which allows a keyfile to be
    retrieved from a device which is first mounted, mainly useful to get
    keyfiles off USB devices etc.

    - [02_manpage.dpatch] likewise
    - [04_fix_unused_or_unitialized_variables.dpatch] likewise
    - [05_segfault_at_nonexisting_device.dpatch] likewise
    - [06_run_udevsettle.dpatch] update for new upstream
  * Disable 03_check_for_root.dpatch. As Ludwig Nussel mentioned on
    dm-crypt@saout.de, cryptsetup 1.0.5 already prints out meaningfull errors
    if expected permissions are not available. Therefore the check for uid ==
    0 is superfluous.
  * [06_run_udevsettle.dpatch] Run udevsettle after device-mapper device
    creation. Fixes issues with temporary device files in /dev/mapper. Patch
    by Reinhard Tartler from Ubuntu. (closes: #444914)

  * Fix debian/rules to not fail to build if autom4te.cache is left behind
    from a previous incomplete build. Patch again taken from Ubuntu.
  * Mention in the crypttab manpage that files are allowed as source. In that
    case they are mounted as loopback device automatically. Thanks to
    Michal Cihar (closes: #451909)
  * At stopping dm-crypt devices really remove the corresponding loopback
    device if one has been used. Thanks to Rene Pavlik for report and to David
    Härdeman, who had the idea for the fix.  (closes: #451916)
  * Also remove loopback devices if the cryptsetup device setup fails.
  * Document a possible deadlock if cryptsetup is invoked as a 'run programm'
    in a udev role. This i related to the invokation of udevsettle in
    cryptsetup. Thanks to Dick Middleton for reporting and debugging.

  * revert the change that for swap devices the vol_id check is run by
    default. if the swap partition is encrypted with a random key, the check
    will always fail. thanks to Mika Bostrom <bostik@bostik.iki.fi>
    (closes: #371135, #371160, #377434)
  * fix the vol_id checkscript to do what it's expected to do.
  * add the un_vol_id checkscript, which does the reverse of vol_id.
  * use 'check=un_vol_id, checkargs=swap' for swap devices per default.
  * added do_close function to cryptdisks.functions, as do_swap needs to use
    it. up to now, 'cryptsetup remove' was invoked regardless whether the
    device contains a LUKS partition or not. this is fixed now too.
  * allow custom check scripts. check only if $CHECK exists in
    /lib/cryptsetup/checks/ and use the given value as full path otherwise.
  * make precheck for no_luks mandatory, fail if any known filesystem is
    found.
  * update crypttab manpage to reflect the checksystem changes. added an own
    section for check scripts. update the CheckSystem documentation.
  * update and simplify the gen-ssl-key script, thanks to Markus Nass

  * fix update-rc.d arguments to start cryptdisks in rc0 and rc6.
    it is not really started [but stopped], but still the links need to be
    named S48cryptdisks. otherwise it will be invoked before umountfs.
  * add initramfs cryptroot functionality, thanks to David Härdeman
    <david@2gen.com> for the patch (closes: #358452)
  * rename /lib/cryptsetup/init_functions to cryptdisks.functions
  * move most of /etc/init.d/cryptdisks to cryptdisks.functions.
    /etc/init.d/cryptdisks now does not much more than importing
    cryptdisks.functions. required for running two seperate cryptdisks
    initscripts.
  * split the cryptdisks initscript into cryptdisks-early and cryptdisks.
    actually both scripts do the same except having slightly different output.
    the early script is run before lvm/evms/... are started, and the other one
    after they are started. (closes: #363007)
  * add support for mount to cryptdisks. this makes it possible to use
    keyfiles from removable media. see the crypttab.5 manpage for more
    information.
  * use upstream cryptsetup tries option instead of the shell code in
    cryptdisks. rename cryptdisks 'retry' option to 'tries'.

  * removed postinst and postrm, empty scripts
  * added a README.Debian and a TODO
  * added a NEWS file for Debian, and explain both the upstream transition

  * update debian/cryptsetup.8 to mention batch-mode and timeout
  * updated cryptdisks
    - modify init script to use lsb functions, at least where possible
    - updated comments for cryptdisks.default
    - moved option parsing and setup of loopback devices to seperate functions.
      added a new include file /lib/cryptsetup/init_functions with functions
      parse_opts, lo_setup, check_key, do_luks, do_noluks, do_swap, do_tmp
    - always check for the source device exists before running cryptsetup
    - hardcode precheck for LUKS to use 'cryptsetup isLuks'. this is much safer
      than allowing other random prechecks, as it manifests that the source
      device actually is a LUKS partition.
    - don't remove the LUKS device when postcheck fails, as the supplied
      password/key is correct anyway.
    - use the new 'timeout' commandline option of cryptsetup instead of an
      external wrapper
    - be silent for not existing devices per default. Implement the loud
      option for crypttab to warn if a device does not exist.
    - remerge postchecks and prechecks into checks.
    - don't disable swap & luks combination, instead disable luks with
      /dev/random, /dev/urandom or /dev/hwrandom as key.
    - run parse_opts before check_key, to know whether we use luks or not

  * check for /usr/bin/timeout before using it in cryptdisks. First, it's
    only available when /usr is mounted, and that is not definitive when
