opensc/pcscd with cryptsetup and LUKS on Debian
------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is an overview on how you can make use of cryptsetup with your
smartcard device supported by opensc/pcscd. If your reader is supported
by openct please refer to the README.openct.gz in the cryptsetup docs.

I assume that you already have an initialized smartcard with a RSA key
that has the proper X509 properties for encryption set. To generate such
a key in hardware on the smartcard you should execute the following
command:

	# pkcs15-init -G rsa/2048 -a [PIN id] -u sign,decrypt

If your smart card doesn't support 2048 bit RSA just change the argument
to the largest size possible.

The decrypt_opensc keyscript decrypts an encrypted key in your boot
partition with the private key on your smartcard. Therefore you have to
create a key for the partition that is to be decrypted using the
smartcard. As pkcs15-crypt does not seem to support PKCS1 padding, the
key is required to have the same size as your RSA key. For a 2048 bit
key use the following (the byte count is 256 as 2048/8 is 256):

	# dd if=/dev/random of=/boot/keys/key bs=1 count=256

Now the key is added to the LUKS partition:

	# cryptsetup luksAddKey /dev/sdXn /boot/keys/key

Enter an already existing pass phrase and watch cryptsetup doing its
job. As we don't want the key in clear on the hard drive, we are going
to encrypt it with the public key to the key on the smartcard.
Read the public key first:

	# pkcs15-tool --read-public-key [key id] -o pubkey

Then encrypt the random data with the extracted key, destroy the
plain text one and remove your public key from the hard drive (it isn't
necessary to shred it as a potential attacker can't use your public key
for anything).

	# openssl rsautl -in /boot/keys/key -inkey pubkey -pubin -raw \
		-encrypt -out /boot/keys/root
	# shred -u /boot/keys/key
	# rm -rf pubkey

Now you'll have to edit /etc/crypttab. The format should be familiar but
I'll state it here again:

	name device /boot/keys/root luks, keyscript=decrypt_opensc

The modules needed by the reader should now be added to
/etc/initramfs-tools/modules, so they are loaded on boot time. For
example yenta_socket, pcmcia, pcmcia_core, serial_cs, rsrc_nonstatic for
PCMCIA card readers.

In a perfect world you would just rebuild the initramfs now and it would
work. Unfortunately there are some additional issues to address. The
most important one is pcscd. Newer versions of pcscd use HAL and dbus to
detect readers. As most people (including me) aren't too enthusiastic
about adding these two daemons to the initramfs, we will rebuild the
daemon to use the traditional polling method with libusb. Again, this
step is only necessary if your reader uses pcscd (for example the
Gemalto PC Card readers).

To do this, download the ccid and pcsc-lite packages from

	<pcsc-lite.alioth.debian.org>

Install the libusb header files, extract the tarballs and build pcscd
with the following commands:

	# apt-get install libusb-dev
	# ./configure --disable-libhal --enable-libusb
	# make
	# make install

Now go to the ccid directory and execute these commands (the option is
only need if you use the libccidtwin.so to access your reader:

	# ./configure [--enable-twinserial]
	# make
	# make install

This installs the new pcscd and it's libraries in /usr/local/. To
reflect the new situation we have to change the initramfs scripts.
Edit /etc/reader.conf to instruct pcscd to use the new libraries (they
should be in /usr/local/pcsc/drivers/) instead of the ones from the Debian
package. Replace everything after line 45 in
/usr/share/initramfs-tools/hooks/cryptopensc with the following chunk:

	for dir in etc/opensc usr/local/pcsc var/run tmp ; do
		if [ ! -d ${DESTDIR}/${dir} ] ; then mkdir -p ${DESTDIR}/${dir} ; fi
	done

	# Install pcscd daemon, drivers, conf file, and include libgcc as
	# well since
	# pcscd utilizes pthread_cancel
	copy_exec /usr/local/sbin/pcscd
	cp -r /usr/local/pcsc ${DESTDIR}/usr/local
	cp /etc/reader.conf ${DESTDIR}/etc
	cp -r /usr/local/lib ${DESTDIR}/usr/local
	# Install opensc commands and conf file
	copy_exec /usr/bin/opensc-tool
	copy_exec /usr/bin/pkcs15-crypt
	cp /lib/libgcc_s.so.1 ${DESTDIR}/lib
	cp /etc/opensc/opensc.conf ${DESTDIR}/etc/opensc

Edit /usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-bottom/cryptopensc and
/usr/share/initramfs-tools/scripts/local-top/cryptopensc to use the new
binary in /usr/local/sbin/pcscd instead of /usr/sbin/pcscd and change
the path in the existence test to:

	if [ ! -e /usr/local/sbin/pcscd ]; then
		exit 0
	fi

If you have completed all the steps up to now, you can update your
initramfs image with:

	# update-initramfs -u -k `uname -r`

and reboot your machine. This leaves a backup of your old initramfs in
the boot partition if something doesn't work. If you have to debug your
initramfs during boot just append the "break=mount" option to the kernel
to have a debug shell just before the root partition would be mounted.
