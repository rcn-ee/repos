qtlocation-opensource-src (5.3.0-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Bump Qt build dependencies.
  * Install headers in their new m-a path. Mark development package as
    Multi-Arch: same.
  * Remove transitional package qtdeclarative5-qtpositioning-plugin.
  * Remove skip_failing_tests.patch. If the test are failing then they should
    not be deactivated but solved, except we have a good reason to do it.
    And sadly we have one, but seems a missing service for the test to run
    properly. Disable tests *just* for this uppload.
  * Remove qtdeclarative5-qtquick2-plugin from the build dependencies, it is
    not really needed.
  * Add dbus as build dependency and run dbus-launch for the tests.
  * Add geoclue as build dependency, it is needed by the tests.
  * Update symbols files with current build log.
  * Update install files.
  * Fix path for removing private headers.
  * Update debian/copyright.
