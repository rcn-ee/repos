Subject: [PATCH 2/5] Reject psk parameter set with invalid passphrase
 character

WPA/WPA2-Personal passphrase is not allowed to include control
characters. Reject a passphrase configuration attempt if that passphrase
includes an invalid passphrase.

This fixes an issue where wpa_supplicant could have updated the
configuration file psk parameter with arbitrary data from the control
interface or D-Bus interface. While those interfaces are supposed to be
accessible only for trusted users/applications, it may be possible that
an untrusted user has access to a management software component that
does not validate the passphrase value before passing it to
wpa_supplicant.

This could allow such an untrusted user to inject up to 63 characters of
almost arbitrary data into the configuration file. Such configuration
file could result in wpa_supplicant trying to load a library (e.g.,
opensc_engine_path, pkcs11_engine_path, pkcs11_module_path,
load_dynamic_eap) from user controlled location when starting again.
This would allow code from that library to be executed under the
wpa_supplicant process privileges.
