  * Patched SDL_fatal.c to use sigaction appropriately instead of signal.
    This allows sigaction-dependent applications such as SBCL to interface

libsdl1.2 (1.2.4-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Okay, 1.2.4 release is good to go!
  * Verified that examples _do_ compile properly (Closes: #139161)
  * tests/testgl.c: The OpenGL test can run in 8 bit RGB mode, but it was
    trying to initialize a 233 mode.  Only two bits of red?  How horrible!
    This grievous injustice has been remidied.  =)
  * Changes for 1.2.4-0.1:
    - The fix from 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0.3 for upstream's -rpath silliness
      was lost in 1.2.4-0, reapplied.
    - SDL does not compile from source.  SDL build-depends on libasound1-dev
      and libarts-dev, but libarts-dev now depends on libasound2-dev, which
      doesn't compile with SDL 1.2.4 and under.  Applied upstream's patch to
      build with libasound2-dev properly.  The patch Works For Me(TM) with
      0.9+0beta12+3+p0 (try saying that ten times fast...)
  * Changes for 1.2.4-0:
    - New upstream version, here's the portion of the changelog which applies
      to the woody packages:
      - Place surfaces in video memory only if there are accellerated blits
      - Bugfix to SDL's blitter (possible fix for #138153?)
      - Part of SDL_opengl.h used a very non-free license, fixed
      - GNU pthreads fixes
      - Explicitly specifies the C calling convention for the API
      These new features are disabled for woody, to minimize the chance of
      breaking the package just before release:
      - Support for DSO loading of EsounD/aRts
      - Support for UNIX RDTSC code
      - Support for 720x576 and 720x480 in fbcon

libsdl1.2 (1.2.3+cvs20020303-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * Finally, a version to upload to Debian!
  * No substantive changes over -0.5.  I didn't get the Sparc test I was
    hoping for before uploading, but at the very least this package will
    not break anything new.  It fixes much that was previously broken,
    however, and should be considered for woody.
  * Changes for 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0.5:
    - autogen.sh: added --add-missing to automake, PowerPC's automake
      wants depcomp.  Yuck.
    - debian/rules, autogen.sh: Revenge of libtool for all the bashing I
      gave it for the rpath mess, it isn't rebuilding properly.  Moved
      libtoolize to autogen.sh and added the --automake parameter.
  * Changes for 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0.4:
    - Added build dep for libtool
  * Changes for 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0.3:
    - Proper fix for the rpath problem.  I hope.
  * Changes for 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0.2:
    - Things built with this package do not run with the current packages
      in Debian.  Shlibs files fixed to depend on (>> 1.2.3).  Existing
      packages need not be recompiled.
    - 1.2.2-3.1 introduced new options for sdl-config which are no longer
      needed.  To prevent build-from-source errors with woody packages,
      these options are once again recognized.
    - Attempt to fix libtool's rpath "feature"
  * Changes for 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0.1:
    - Fix for #128075 got lost in -0, put it back (Thanks Michel!)
  * Changes for 1.2.3+cvs20020303-0:
    - New upstream version (Closes: #135898)
    - Upstream fix for #114808 brings Debian's ABI back inline with that
      used by other distributions (Closes: #136237)
    - Disabled GGI in the -all package.  This is against my stated
      intention when adopting the package, however the GGI target is not
      maintained upstream at this time.  A patch to fix support for GGI is
      welcome, but for now Sam Lantinga has urged it be disabled.
      (Closes: #108558)
    - alsalib-dev has been removed from build deps.  libasound1-dev takes
      its place explicitly, since that's currently the only version which
      actually works with SDL.  libasound2 support is an upstream todo.
    - Tweaked build for automake 1.5, thanks Denis! (Closes: #115422)
    - Added automake to build deps for the above.
    - The SDL and X Extension Library mess has been provided with a better
      fix upstream.  (Closes: #128827, #122754)
      [ This has since been confirmed to _not_ need package recompiles! ]
    - Frobbed libsdl1.2debian's deps to prefer the -oss package by
      default.  This is to stop people in #SDL and #OpenGL from whining
      about how trying to install any SDL app with apt pulls in about 15
      megs worth of cruft that 2/3 of all users could not possibly care
      less about.  This is for you, Erik!  ;)
  * Changes for 1.2.2-3.5:
    - Adopted package.
    - Remove config.cache in clean target (fixes a lintian error)

    *** SDL-based plugins are compiled in an environment where the extension
    *** libraries' API is what SDL expects it to be.  The libsdl1.2 package
    *** maintainer should keep in touch with the XFree86 package maintainer
    *** (and vice versa) to ensure that this package relationship is properly
    *** declared.  Alternatively, perhaps one day those extension libraries

  * NMU to fix the Big SDL and X Extension Library Problem (Closes: #114808)
  * Thanks to Eric Gillespie, Jr. for help preparing this solution
  * configure.in: remove XF86VMLIB, XF86DGALIB, XF86VMLIB hacks
  * ltmain.sh: corrected a boatload of cases where unquoted,
    possibly-undefined variables were used in string comparison tests
  * sdl.m4: change macro AM_PATH_SDL for usage by shared libraries,
    exporting SDL_LIBS_FOR_LIBS
  * sdl-config.1: wrote a manual page for sdl-config
  * sdl-config.in:
    - added --library-libs option, to be used by libraries that want to use
      sdl-config; ordinary apps can and should still use --libs (or
      --static-libs)
    - documented "--library-libs" option in usage message
    - documented "--static-libs" option in usage message (when it is
      available)
  * re-ran libtoolize --force --copy; aclocal; automake --foreign; autoconf

    64 files changed, 5350 insertions(+), 2379 deletions(-)
  * debian/control:
    - use xlibmesa-dev as a real alternative for build-dependency on libgl-dev
    - use libasound1-dev as real alternative for build-dependency on
      alsalib-dev (Closes: #114583)
    - bumped Standards-Version
    - cleaned up package descriptions a bit, and made the short
      descriptions unique with respect to each other
    - libsdl1.2-dev provides libsdl-dev
    - renamed the actual shared library packages from "libsd1.2*" to
      "libsdl1.2debian"; this is necessary because:
      1) 3 static X extension libraries are no longer present in the libSDL
         shared object on half the architectures in Debian;
      2) SDL-dependent packages on those same architectures, if built
         against libsdl1.2-dev 1.2.2-3, didn't link against the static X
         extension libraries themselves, thanks to sdl-config being fixed
         incorrectly in that same version;
      3) Unresolved symbol errors are not something we want to subject our
         users to;
      4) It's better to rename the shared library packages than have them
         all Conflict: with every existing package that depends on
         libsdl1.2 (that's just asking for trouble).
    - added appropriate Replaces and Conflicts to libsdl1.2debian* packages
    - changed libsdl1.2debian dependency to be on libsdl1.2debian* packages
  * debian/libsdl1.2debian-{all,arts,esd,oss}.lintian: added lintian overrides
    file to suppress lintian error on i386 "shlib-with-non-pic-code"; this
    warning is caused due to one of two problems:
    1) There is a bug in the SDL's .asm files, since they are not written to
       support PIC correctly; or
    2) The SDL .asm files are written correctly, and NASM simply does not
       produce a valid PIC object. IOW, it may look PIC, and work like PIC,
       but isn't actually conforming to PIC specs in one way or another.
    So it's either an upstream bug in libsdl1.2 or an upstream bug in nasm; in
    any event, the error only appears on i386, which seems to be able to
    handle the SDL shared library just fine anyway.  Thanks to Ben Collins for
    this analysis.
  * debian/libsdl1.2-dev.manpages: ship sdl-config.1 manpage
  * debian/rules:
    - add "--with-pic" to all configure calls (not sure why this isn't the
      default)
    - reference "libsdl1.2debian" where appropriate instead of "libsdl1.2"
    - ship new lintian override files
