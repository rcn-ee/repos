gem2deb (0.30) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Gem2Deb::Metadata:
    - workaround git usage in gemspecs. The fact that Debian source packages
      are *not* git repositories makes it necessary to patch upstream gemspec to
      drop usage of `git ls-files` in several packages. This change makes
      gem2deb try to override that with sane defaults for a Debian package.
      (Closes: #800933)
    - fail the build if there is a gemspec in the source package but we fail
      to load it.
  * gem2deb-test-runner: when dependency resolution is requested, fail if
    there is no working source gemspec to read the package name from.

gem2deb (0.25.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * gem2deb-test-runner: put directories under debian/ first in GEM_PATH to
    make sure dependency resolution uses the metadata installed during the
    build with precedence over metadata already installed in the system. Fixes
    building packages on non-clean systems where the package you are building
    may have a version already installed.
  * dh_ruby --gem-install:
    - handle not installing test files when they are explicitly listed in the
      gemspec under `spec.test_files = ...`.

gem2deb (0.25) unstable; urgency=medium

  * debian/control: switch from git:// to https:// in Vcs-Git:
  * dh-make-ruby: stop creating debian/ruby-test-files.yaml. In my experience
    that almost never works out of the box.
    - Note that dh_ruby still supports it, we just won't autogenerate that
      when creating new packaging from scratch anymore.
  * gem2deb-test-runner: also set GEM_PATH when running tests. This makes
    tests work out of the box when using --gem-install
  * dh_ruby --gem-install:
    - Only install files that match a whitelist, to avoid having all the
      clutter that usually comes in source packages installed to binary
      packages.
    - Implement correct installation of native extensions

  * gem installer: avoid installing the debian/ directory when upstream
    metadata specifies the packages files as '**/*'
  * test runner: call `rubyX.Y -S rake` instead of `rakeX.Y`. Ruby 2.3 does
    not ship a rake2.3 anymore.
  * dh-make-ruby: change generated Vcs-Git URL from git:// to https://

gem2deb (0.22.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Skip integration tests during the build. When buildind only architecture
    independent packages (i.e. with dpkg-buildpackage -A or sbuild
    --arch-all-only), the nested dpkg-buildpackage calls in the integration
    tests will fail. We'll still run the integration tests under autopkgtest
    though.

gem2deb (0.20) unstable; urgency=medium

  * gem2deb-test-runner:
    - when checking dependencies, don't add rubygems-integration paths from
      different Ruby versions to GEM_PATH.
    - simplify the command line that runs rake
    - gem2deb/rake/testtask: Use options to make all test runs verbose by
      default
    - gem2deb/rake/spectask: add a utility task for running tests with rspec
    - print a sbuild-like banner before start running tests
  * dh-make-ruby: generate debian/ruby-tests.rake using gem2deb/rake/spectask
  * dh_ruby:
    - print sbuild-like banners before installing files and before building
      native extensions

  * gem2deb: download .gem files in a temporary directory
  * gem2deb-test-runner: add dependency on ruby-minitest
  * dh-make-ruby: add README's uncommented to debian/ruby-foo.docs

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Wed, 15 Jul 2015 18:28:03 -0300

gem2deb (0.18.3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * gem2deb-test-runner: add dependency on ruby-test-unit
    - Ruby 2.1 had an embedded copy of test/unit, so packages using it in
      their test suite got away with not build-depending on ruby-test-unit
    - Ruby 2.2 does not include test/unit anymore, so a few dozens of packages
      now FTBFS. Since we have a transition to make, instead of waiting for
      all those packages to be fixed, let's workaround that centrally here.

gem2deb (0.18.2) unstable; urgency=medium

  * gem2deb-test-runner: when under autopkgtest, don't pass any GEM_PATH at
    all, no even an empty one. This fixes dependency checks under autopkgtest.
  * dh-make-ruby: convert *all* underscores (`_`) to dashes (`-`) when
    converting gem names to source package names (not just the first one).
  * dh_ruby: install gemspecs to rubygems-integration directories using
    API_VERSION (e.g. 2.2.0) and not the short version (e.g. 2.2)
  * dh-make-ruby: avoid converting gem dependencies on exact versions
    (= 0.1.2) to Debian; that is never going to work.

 -- Antonio Terceiro <terceiro@debian.org>  Wed, 17 Jun 2015 19:40:18 -0300

gem2deb (0.18.1) unstable; urgency=medium

  * gem2deb-test-runner: include `Gem.path` in GEM_PATH so that dependency
    checking works against the system-installed gemspecs.

gem2deb (0.18) unstable; urgency=medium

  * make dh-make-ruby resilient against a corrupt "gem name to package name"
    cache (Closes: #786841)
  * dh_ruby: install gemspecs _before_ running tests so that checking
    dependencies when running tests actually works.
  * gem2deb-test-runner: fix dependency checking during build (by fixing name
    of Rubygems environment variable, s/GEMPATH/GEM_PATH/)
  * gem2deb-test-runner: when called with --check-dependencies, do not exit
    after successfully checking dependencies, but before running tests.

gem2deb (0.17) unstable; urgency=medium

  * dh-make-ruby:
    - fix call to wrap-and-sort
    - add -w/--overwrite option to overwrite files under debian/.
      Closes: #785106
    - only call wrap-and-sort if either there was no previous
      packaging, or -w/--overwrite was passed.
    - when acting on an existing source package, read the source package name
      from debian/changelog.
    - always create test suite files to make dh-make-ruby idempotent
    - suggest checking dependencies during build and on DEP-8 tests
  * gem2deb-test-runner:
    - add -c/--check-dependencies to check for dependencies (as declared in
      the Rubygems metadata, not as declared in debian/control) before running
      the tests (Closes: #785120, #770748)
    - always print command lines used to run the tests
    - add support for passing options via the GEM2DEB_TEST_RUNNER environment
      variable
    - add support for checking Rubygems dependencies during build
    - Breaks:/Replaces: gem2deb (<< 0.17~) because lib/gem2deb/metadata.rb was

  * Add patch from Cédric Boutillier, from a debian-ruby@ discussion from
    2012, that makes gem2tgz pick the most recent (in terms of gem version)

  * bin/dh-make-ruby: use '.' (current directory) as default target.
    Closes: #777747
  * dh-make-ruby: run wrap-and-sort after generating boilerplate from

    -I/usr/lib/ruby/vendor_ruby in command lines and eases debugging running
    processes for packages that e.g. hang while running their tests.
  * debian/requires-rubygems.overrides it not supported anymore. Patching out

  * SetupRbInstaller: copy system copy of setup.rb instead of symlinking. This
    will fail if it's not there.

  * dh-make-ruby: generate 'Testsuite: autopkgtest-pkg-ruby' to not conflict
    with DEP-8 spec (i.e., if the 'Testsuite' field contains 'autopkgtest',
    then debian/tests/control *must* exist).
    - autopkgtest-pkg-ruby will be handled by autopkgtest and the implicit
      test control data that uses gem2deb-test-runner will be used.
  * improved "usage: " banner in several of the provided programs
  * SetupRbInstaller: always use the system copy of setup.rb
  * Gem2Deb#run: always print command lines being executed. This makes build
    logs much more detailed, what is a good thing.
  * dh-make-ruby: look for test files recursively in generated
    debian/ruby-tests.rake for both test/unit and rspec style tests.
  * dh-make-ruby: gem dependencies will now be included in debian/control
    uncommented and transformed to Debian package names, i.e. foo → ruby-foo,
    except for known exceptions (such as rake and rails initially).

    will now auto-detect Ruby packages and assume an implicit tests
    definition. debian/tests/control.ex will be created instead, with comments
    explaining to either modify it and rename to control, or delete it.
  * dh-make-ruby: when test/ or spec/ exists, create debian/ruby-tests.rake
    with the appropriate rake invocation to run the tests, instead of being
    insecure and creating files all commented out.
  * install 'gem2deb/rake/testtask.rb' to gem2deb-test-runner instead of

    as ")" and whitespace in general, and improves security against
    maliciously-crafted filenames which could inject unwanted shell
    commands in the system that is building a package with gem2deb.
