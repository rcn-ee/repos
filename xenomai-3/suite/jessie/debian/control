Description: Xenomai runtime utilities
 Xenomai is a real-time development framework cooperating with the Linux
 kernel in order to provide a pervasive, interface-agnostic, hard real-time
 support to user-space applications, seamlessly integrated into the GNU/Linux
 environment. Xenomai provides its own API and emulation layers ("skins") to
 make migration from other RTOS easier. Examples are: pSOS+, VxWorks, POSIX.
 .
 This package contains the runtime programs and the testsuite for the Xenomai
 realtime system.

 .
 This package contains sources for Xenomai kernel-space support - 
 These are intended for use with kernel-package and a virgin Linux
 source tree. 
 .
 Note: These sources are included with the prepare-kernel.sh script
 which should be run to patch the Linux kernel sources with Xenomai
 kernel-space support.
