  * Change symbols files and lintian overrides to provide qtbase-abi-5-1-0.
  * Minimal improve of README.source with private symbols handling.
  * Remove doc packages. The build system has changed and I can't build them
    anymore.

  * Mark libgbm-dev as linux-any. Other OSs do not have it.

  * From the armhf build log: "The -arch and -host-arch options are obsolete".
    Remove the relevant armv6 option from debian/rules.
  * Add a lintian override for libqt5xml5, which rightfully declares a
    dependency on qtbase-abi-5-0-2.
