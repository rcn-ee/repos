.SH NAME
.PP
rdoc2.3 \- Generate documentation from Ruby script files
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP
rdoc2.3 [options]  [names...]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Files are parsed, and the information they contain collected, before any
output is produced. This allows cross references between all files to be
resolved. If a name is a directory, it is traversed. If no names are
specified, all Ruby files in the current directory (and subdirectories) are
processed.
.PP
Available output formatters: chm, html, ri, xml
.PP
For information on where the output goes, use:
.nf
\&    rdoc \-\-help\-output
