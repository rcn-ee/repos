				 Granted Rights

 1. You are granted the non-exclusive rights set forth in this license
    provided you agree to and comply with any and all conditions in this
    license.  Whole or partial distribution of the Software, or software
    items that link with the Software, in any form signifies acceptance of
    this license.
 .
 2. You may copy and distribute the Software in unmodified form provided
    that the entire package, including - but not restricted to - copyright,
    trademark notices and disclaimers, as released by the initial developer
    of the Software, is distributed.

    modifications, in a form that is separate from the Software, such as
    patches. The following restrictions apply to modifications:
 .
     a. Modifications must not alter or remove any copyright notices in
        the Software.
 .
     b. When modifications to the Software are released under this
        license, a non-exclusive royalty-free right is granted to the
        initial developer of the Software to distribute your modification
        in future versions of the Software provided such versions remain
        available under these terms in addition to any other license(s) of
        the initial developer.
 .
 4. You may distribute machine-executable forms of the Software or
    machine-executable forms of modified versions of the Software, provided
    that you meet these restrictions:
 .
     a. You must include this license document in the distribution.
 .
     b. You must ensure that all recipients of the machine-executable forms
        are also able to receive the complete machine-readable source code
        to the distributed Software, including all modifications, without
        any charge beyond the costs of data transfer, and place prominent
        notices in the distribution explaining this.
 .
     c. You must ensure that all modifications included in the
        machine-executable forms are available under the terms of this
        license.
 .
 5. You may use the original or modified versions of the Software to
    compile, link and run application programs legally developed by you
    or by others.
 .
 6. You may develop application programs, reusable components and other
    software items that link with the original or modified versions of the
    Software.  These items, when distributed, are subject to the following
    requirements:
 .
     a. You must ensure that all recipients of machine-executable forms of
        these items are also able to receive and use the complete
        machine-readable source code to the items without any charge
        beyond the costs of data transfer.
 .
     b. You must explicitly license all recipients of your items to use
        and re-distribute original and modified versions of the items in
        both machine-executable and source code forms. The recipients must
        be able to do so without any charges whatsoever, and they must be
        able to re-distribute to anyone they choose.
 .
     c. If the items are not available to the general public, and the
        initial developer of the Software requests a copy of the items,
        then you must supply one.
 .
			    Limitations of Liability
 .
 In no event shall the initial developers or copyright holders be liable
 for any damages whatsoever, including - but not restricted to - lost
 revenue or profits or other direct, indirect, special, incidental or
 consequential damages, even if they have been advised of the possibility
 of such damages, except to the extent invariable law, if any, provides
 otherwise.
 .
			          No Warranty
 .
 The Software and this license document are provided AS IS with NO WARRANTY
 OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING THE WARRANTY OF DESIGN, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS
 FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
