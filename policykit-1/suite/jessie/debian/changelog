policykit-1 (0.113-2) experimental; urgency=medium

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * policykit-1.links: statically alias polkit.service (upstream's name)
    as polkitd.service (Debian's historical name)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/policykit-1.{pre,pos}inst: Temporarily mask polkitd.service while
    policykit-1 is unpackaged but not yet configured. During that time we
    don't yet have our D-Bus policy in /etc so that polkitd cannot work yet.
    This can be dropped once the D-Bus policy moves to /usr.
    (Closes: #794723, LP: #1447654)

policykit-1 (0.113-1) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * policykit-1.postinst: Don't kill polkitd under systemd, but properly
    restart it. This avoids killing it shortly after systemd tries to
    bus-activate it on installation. (LP: #1447654)

  [ Simon McVittie ]
  * Disable silent build rules. (Previously done in Ubuntu, although
    it seems to have been lost in a merge somewhere.)
  * New upstream release
    - drop most patches: they either came from upstream, or have been
      merged upstream
    - add new function to symbols file
    - fixes CVE-2015-4625, CVE-2015-3218, CVE-2015-3255, CVE-2015-3256
  * Annotate remaining patches with a bit more information. They are:
    - 01_pam_polkit.patch: use Debian's common-* infrastructure,
      plus pam_env to get the global environment and locale.
      Debian-specific.
    - 02_gettext.patch: Use gettext to translate .policy files at
      runtime, allowing for Ubuntu-style language packs.
      Debian-specific (mainly for Ubuntu's benefit, really).
    - 05_revert-admin-identities-unix-group-wheel.patch: Debian does
      not use the "wheel" group like Red Hat derivatives do;
      treat uid 0 as the administrative identity instead.
      Debian-specific.
    - 08_chdir_root.patch: Explicitly use chdir("/") instead of
      relying on user's home in `getent passwd` being set properly.
      Potentially upstreamable?
  * policykit-1.postinst: restart polkit.service, not polkitd.service
    (which doesn't exist)

policykit-1 (0.112-5) experimental; urgency=medium

  * Team upload.
  * Go back to mozjs 1.8.5, like the version in unstable: mozjs 17 has
    been removed from Debian, and mozjs 24 requires significant upstream
    changes and no longer has a C API (Closes: #776744)
  * Add a symlink so the old library can run the new agent helper
    (Closes: #699447)
  * Add patch from upstream to work around older versions of libpam-systemd
    which would give root processes the real uid's XDG_RUNTIME_DIR
    under su; it shouldn't be necessary any more, but is harmless
    (Closes: #772125)
  * Replace 03_complete_session.patch with a change from upstream
    which seems like a more correct solution for LP#445303, LP#649939
  * Add patches from upstream to treat background processes as part of
    the same uid's active GUI session if any, fixing use of
    dbus-user-session (Closes: #779988)
  * Add patches from upstream to fix some memory leaks (Closes: #775158,
    LP: #1417637)
  * Add patch from upstream to fix redundant removal of an event source
  * Add patch to use libsystemd instead of the libsystemd-login compat
    library (Closes: #779756)

  * debian/control: Depends against libpam-systemd instead of just systemd

    registers a logind session properly (Closes: #745983)

  * Remove 00git_pkexec_pam_env.patch and 09_link_libmozjs.patch, both merged

policykit-1 (0.109-1) experimental; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #689473)
  * Update Build-Depends:
    - Bump libglib2.0-dev to (>= 2.30.0).
    - Add libmozjs185-dev for the JS rules support.
  * Remove polkitbackend library.
  * Use systemd service file provided by upstream.
  * Reload systemd as the name of the .service file has changed.
  * Update policykit-1.install:
    - Private binaries have been moved to /usr/lib/polkit-1.
    - The extension system has been removed.
    - The .pkla files are gone and so is /var/lib/polkit-1.
  * Remove obsolete conffiles and the corresponding (empty) directories on
    upgrades.
  * Convert the old localauthority conf files to the new JavaScript based
    rules file format and make sure it is executed before 50-default.rules.
  * Refresh patches to apply without fuzz.
  * The polkitd daemon now runs as unprivileged polkitd user instead of root.
    Create this system user in postinst and change the directory permissions
    accordingly so the daemon has access to the rules files.
  * debian/patches/08_chdir_root.patch: Explicitly use chdir("/") instead of
    relying on $HOME being set properly.
  * Since /etc/polkit-1/rules.d/50-default.rules is a proper conffile, remove
    the comment from upstream that changes to that file are not preserved on
    upgrades. (Closes: #580634)
  * debian/patches/09_link_libmozjs.patch: Explicitly link against libmozjs,
    even if that library is dlopenend as we want to have a proper shlibs
    dependency.
  * Use --no-as-needed flag to ensure the linker doesn't remove the libmozjs
    dependency.
  * Use dh-autoreconf to update the build system.
  * Update the Homepage: field.

    environment variable to its default value $HOME/.Xauthority if unset.
    Some display managers, like KDM, do not set the XAUTHORITY variable, so
    starting graphical applications via pkexec was broken in those
    environments. (Closes: #671497)

    administrator, for compatibility with Debian and sudo itself. Keep "admin"

  * debian/libpolkit-gobject-1-0.symbols: Update for new symbols.
