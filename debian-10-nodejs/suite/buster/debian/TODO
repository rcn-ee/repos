- DONE : libudns to libc-ares transition : libudns is to be dropped one day

- However, libc-ares 1.7.1 currently does not support parse_mx_reply, it's been
added upstream, so the corresponding debian/patches/cares-disable-mx.patch must
be removed when 1.7.2 is released and available as a debian package.

- support nodejs shebang, notice lintian maintainers ?
