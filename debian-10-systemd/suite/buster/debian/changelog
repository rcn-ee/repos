systemd (236-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * debian/tests/upstream: Only show ≥ warning in journal dumps.
    Showing the entire debug log is too hard to scan visually, and most of
    the time the warnings and errors are sufficient to explain a failure.
    Put the journal files into the artifacts though, in case the debug
    information is necessary.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream version 236
    - nspawn: Adjust path to static resolv.conf to support split usr.
      (Closes: #881310)
    - networkd: Don't stop networkd if CONFIG_FIB_RULES=n in kernel.
      (Closes: #881823)
    - core: Fix segfault in compile_bind_mounts() when BindPaths= or
      BindReadOnlyPaths= is set. (Closes: #883380)
    - meson: Link NSS modules with -z nodelete to fix memory leak in
      nss-systemd. (Closes: #883407)
    - logind: Make sure we don't acces m->action_what if it's not initialized.
      (Closes: #882270)
    - systemctl: Ignore shutdown's "-t" argument. (Closes: #882245)
    - core: Be more defensive if we can't determine per-connection socket
      peer. (Closes: #879603)
    - bpf-firewall: Actually invoke BPF_PROG_ATTACH to check whether
      cgroup/bpf is available. (Closes: #878965)
  * Rebase patches
  * Update symbols file for libsystemd0
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.2
  * Clean up old /var/lib/systemd/clock on upgrade.
    The clock file used by systemd-timesyncd is now stored in
    StateDirectory=systemd/timesync. (Closes: #883605)
  * Stop creating systemd-timesync system user.
    DynamicUser=yes has been enabled for systemd-timesyncd.service so
    allocating a system user statically is no longer necessary.
  * Document removal of systemd-{timesync,journal-gateway,journal-upload} user.
    We no longer create those system users as the corresponding services now
    use DynamicUser=yes. Removing those system users automatically is tricky,
    as the relevant services might be running during upgrade. Add a NEWS
    entry instead which documents this change.
  * Revert "udev-rules: Permission changes for /dev/dri/renderD*"
    This would introduce a new system group "render". As the name is rather
    generic, this needs further discussion first, so revert this change for
    now.

systemd (235-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Switch from XC-Package-Type to Package-Type. As of dpkg-dev 1.15.7
    Package-Type is recognized as an official field name.
  * Install modprobe configuration file to /lib/modprobe.d.
    Otherwise it is not read by kmod. (Closes: #879191)

  [ Felipe Sateler ]
  * Backport upstream (partial) fix for combined DynamicUser= + User=
    UID was not allowed to be different to GID, which is normally the case in
    debian, due to the group users being allocated the GID 100 without an
    equivalent UID 100 being allocated.
  * Backport upstream patches to fully make DynamicUser=yes + static,
    pre-existing User= work.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Add missing python3-minimal dependency to systemd-tests
  * Drop long-obsolete systemd-bus-proxy system user
    systemd-bus-proxy hasn't been shipped since before stretch and never
    created any files. Thus clean up the obsolete system user on upgrades.
    (Closes: #878182)
  * Drop static systemd-journal-gateway system user
    systemd-journal-gatewayd.service now uses DynamicUser=, so we don't need
    to create this statically any more. Don't remove the user on upgrades
    though, as there is likely still be a running process. (Closes: #878183)
  * Use DynamicUser= for systemd-journal-upload.service.
  * Add Recommends: libnss-systemd to systemd-sysv.
    This is useful to actually be able to resolve dynamically created system
    users with DynamicUser=true. This concept is going to be used much more
    in future versions and (hopefully) third-party .services, so pulling it
    into the default installation seems prudent now.
  * resolved: Fix loop on packets with pseudo dns types.
    (CVE-2017-15908, Closes: #880026, LP: #1725351)
  * bpf-firewall: Properly handle kernels without BPF cgroup but with TRIE maps.
    Fixes "Detaching egress BPF: Invalid argument" log spam. (Closes: #878965)
  * Fix MemoryDenyWriteExecution= bypass with pkey_mprotect() (LP: #1725348)

  * Refresh patches
  * Bump Build-Depends on libmount-dev to (>= 2.30)
  * Install new modprobe.d config file
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.1.1

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Merge logind-kill-off autopkgtest into logind test.
    This was horribly inefficient as a separate test (from commit
    6bd0dab41e), as that cost two VM resets plus accompanying boots; and
    this does not change any state thus does not require this kind of
    isolation.

systemd (234-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Various fixes for the upstream autopkgtest.

  [ Felipe Sateler ]
  * Add fdisk to the dependencies of the upstream autopkgtest.
    The upstream autopkgtest uses sfdisk, which is now in the non-essential
    fdisk package. (Closes: #872119)
  * Disable nss-systemd on udeb builds
  * Correctly disable resolved on udeb builds
  * Help fix collisions in libsystemd-shared symbols by versioning them.
    Backport upstream patch to version the symbols provided in the private
    library, so that they cannot confuse unversioned pam modules or libraries
    linked into them. (Closes: #873708)

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * Cherrypick upstream networkd-test.py assertion/check fixes.
    This resolves ADT test suite failures, when running tests under lxc/lxd
    providers.
  * Cherrypick arm* seccomp fixes.
    This should resolve ADT test failures, on arm64, when running as root.
  * Disable KillUserProcesses, yet again, with meson this time.
  * initramfs-tools: trigger udevadm add actions with subsystems first.
    This updates the initramfs-tools init-top udev script to trigger udevadm
    actions with type specified. This mimics the systemd-udev-trigger.service.
    Without type specified only devices are triggered, but triggering
    subsystems may also be required and should happen before triggering the
    devices. This is the case for example on s390x with zdev generated udev
    rules. (LP: #1713536)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * (Re)add --quiet flag to addgroup calls.
    This is now safe with adduser having been fixed to no longer suppress
    fatal error messages if --quiet is used. (Closes: #837871)
  * Switch back to default GCC (Closes: #873661)
  * Drop systemd-timesyncd.service.d/disable-with-time-daemon.conf.
    All major NTP implementations ship a native service file nowadays with a
    Conflicts=systemd-timesyncd.service so this drop-in is no longer
    necessary. (Closes: #873185)

  * Switch to gcc-6 on all architectures, working around an FTBFS on mips64el,

    would fail that.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Revert "units: Tell login to preserve environment"
    Environment=LANG= LANGUAGE= LC_CTYPE= ... as used in the getty units is
    not unsetting the variables but instead sets it to an empty var. Passing
    that environment to login messes up the system locale settings and
    breaks programs like gpg-agent.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * New upstream version 234
    - tmpfiles: Create /var/log/lastlog if it does not exist.
      (Closes: #866313)
    - network: Bridge vlan without PVID. (Closes: #859941)
  * Rebase patches
  * Switch build system from autotools to meson.
    Update the Build-Depends accordingly.
  * Update fsckd patch for meson
  * udev autopkgtest: no longer install test-udev binary manually.
    This is now done by the upstream build system.
  * Update symbols file for libsystemd0
  * Update lintian override for systemd-tests.
    Upstream now installs manual and unsafe tests in subdirectories of
    /usr/lib/systemd/tests/, so ignore those as well.
  * Bump Standards-Version to 4.0.0
  * Change priority of libnss-* packages from extra to optional.
  * Use UTF-8 locale when building the package.
    Otherwise meson will be pretty unhappy when trying to process files with
    unicode characters. Use C.UTF-8 as this locale is pretty much guaranteed
    to be available everywhere.
  * Mark test-timesync as manual.
    The test tries to setup inotify watches for /run/systemd/netif/links
    which fails in a buildd environment where systemd is not active.
  * Do not link udev against libsystemd-shared.
    We ship udev in a separate binary package, so can't use
    libsystemd-shared, which is part of the systemd binary package.
  * Avoid requiring a "kvm" system group.
    This group is not universally available and as a result generates a
    warning during boot. As kvm is only really useful if the qemu package is
    installed and this package already takes care of setting up the proper
    permissions for /dev/kvm, drop this rule from 50-udev-default.rules.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * udev README.Debian: Update transitional rules and mention *.link files.
    - 01-mac-for-usb.link got replaced with 73-usb-net-by-mac.rules
    - /etc/systemd/network/50-virtio-kernel-names.link is an upgrade
      transition for VMs with virtio
    - Describe *.link files as a simpler/less error prone (but also less
      flexible) way of customizing interface names. (Closes: #868002)

  * Backport upstream PR #5531.
    This delays opening the mdns and llmnr sockets until a network has enabled
    them. This silences annoying messages when networkd receives such packets
    without expecting them: Got mDNS UDP packet on unknown scope.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * resolved: Disable DNSSEC by default on stretch and zesty.
    Both Debian stretch and Ubuntu zesty are close to releasing, switch to
    DNSSEC=off by default for those. Users can still turn it back on with
    DNSSEC=allow-downgrade (or even "yes").

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Add Conflicts against hal.
    Since v183, udev no longer supports RUN+="socket:". This feature is
    still used by hal, but now generates vast amounts of errors in the
    journal. Thus force the removal of hal by adding a Conflicts to the udev
    package. This is safe, as hal is long dead and no longer useful.
  * Drop systemd-ui Suggests
    systemd-ui is unmaintained upstream and not particularly useful anymore.
  * journal: fix up syslog facility when forwarding native messages.
    Native journal messages (_TRANSPORT=journal) typically don't have a
    syslog facility attached to it. As a result when forwarding the
    messages to syslog they ended up with facility 0 (LOG_KERN).
    Apply syslog_fixup_facility() so we use LOG_USER instead.

  * debian/tests/systemd-fsckd: Create /etc/default/grub.d if necessary
  * debian/rules: Drop check for linking to libs in /usr.
    This was just an approximation, as booting without an initrd could still be

    default this is now completely moot.
  * Move kernel-install initrd script to a later prefix.
    60- does not leave much room for scripts that want to run before initrd
    building (which is usually one of the latest things to do), so bump to 85.
    Thanks to Sjoerd Simons for the suggestion.
  * Disable 99-default.link instead of the udev rule for disabling persistent
    interface names.
    Disabling 80-net-setup-link.rules will also cause ID_NET_DRIVER to not be

    name in general. So disable the actual default link policy instead. Still

    The special 'key handling' inhibitors should always work regardless of

  * Stop mentioning snapshot and restore in the package description.
    Support for the .snapshot unit type has been removed upstream.

    5 to 10 seconds, and sync the journal after every iteration.
  * debian/extra/checkout-upstream: Try again after one minute if git checkout
    fails, to avoid failures from transient network errors.
  * debian/tests/systemd-fsckd: Use grub.d/50-cloudimg-settings.cfg as a
    template for generating our custom one instead of 90-autopkgtest.cfg. The
    latter does not exist on non-x86 architectures and is not relevant for
    this test.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Skip journal test for test_bash_crash when
    running against upstream, as this currently fails most of the time. To be
    investigated.
  * debian/tests/networkd: Skip test_coldplug_dhcp_ip6 when running against
    upstream, as this is brittle there. To be investigated.

  * systemd-coredump.postinst: Create systemd-coredump system user.
  * debian/tests/systemd-fsckd: Tame overly strict test for failed plymouth
    unit, which is a race condition with plymouthd auto-stopping.
    (LP: #1543144)
  * Drop timedated-don-t-rely-on-usr-being-mounted-in-the-ini.patch.
    initramfs-tools has mounted /usr since Jessie, and tzdata now creates
    /etc/localtime as a symlink too (see #803144).
  * Use-different-default-paths-for-various-binaries.patch: Drop path changes
    for setcap (which is already a build dep and not used at all) and sulogin
    (which is now in util-linux).
  * Remove obsolete udev maintainer script checks:
    - Drop check for kernel >= 2.6.32, which released in 2009.
    - Drop restarting of some daemons due to the devtmpfs migration, which
      happened before the above kernel even.
    - Drop support for forcing upgrades on kernels known not to work via
      /etc/udev/kernel-upgrade. Don't pretend that this would help, as users
      could end up with a non-bootable system. Always fail early in preinst
      when it's still possible to install a working kernel.
    - Drop postinst test for "running in containers" -- it's actually possible
      to run udev in containers if you mount /sys r/w and you know what you
      are doing. Also, the init.d script and systemd service do that check
      again.
    - Keep the kernel feature and chroot checks, as these are still useful.
      Simplify check_kernel_features() by eliminating some variables.
    - Drop debconf templates. Two of them are obsolete, and having
      CONFIG_SYSFS_DEPRECATED is now so implausible that this doesn't warrant
      the overhead and translator efforts.
  * Drop debian/tests/ifupdown-hotplug. The units moved into ifupdown, so the
    test should go there too (see #814312).
  * debian/tests/control: Reorder tests and add a comment which ones should
    not be run for an upstream build.
  * debian/tests/control: Rearrange tests and avoid removing test dependencies
    to minimize testbed resets.
  * Add debian/extra/checkout-upstream: Script to replace the current
     source with a checkout of an upstream pull request, branch, or commit,
     and remove debian/patches/. Call from debian/rules if $TEST_UPSTREAM is

  * systemd-timesyncd.service.d/disable-with-time-daemon.conf: Also don't run

    provides time synchronization with the host. (Closes: #812522)
  * Drop Michael Stapelberg from Uploaders:, he stopped maintenance long ago.
    Thanks Michael for your great work in the past!
  * Replace "sysv-rc" dependency with Conflicts: openrc, file-rc. The
    rationale from #739679 still applies, but with the moving of
    {invoke,update}-rc.d to init-system-helpers we don't actually need
    anything from sysv-rc any more other than the assumption that SysV init
    scripts are enabled in /etc/rc?.d/ for the SysV generator to work (and
    file-rc and openrc don't do that).
  * debian/tests/timedated: Verify /etc/localtime symlink. Skip verifying the
    /etc/timezone file (which is Debian specific) if $TEST_UPSTREAM is set.
  * debian/tests/localed-locale: Check /etc/locale.conf if $TEST_UPSTREAM is

  * debian/tests/localed-x11-keymap: Test /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/00-keyboard.conf
    if $TEST_UPSTREAM is set.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Check for reaching graphical.target
    instead of default.target, as the latter is a session systemd state only.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Skip tests which are known to fail/not
    applicable with testing upstream builds.
  * Drop Fix-up-tmpfiles.d-permissions-properly.patch:
    - /run/lock is already created differently by
      Make-run-lock-tmpfs-an-API-fs.patch, and contradicts to that.
    - /run/lock/lockdev/ isn't being used anywhere and got dropped
      upstream; backport the patch (tmpfiles-drop-run-lock-lockdev.patch).
    - Move dropping of "group:wheel" (which has never existed in Debian) into
      debian/rules, to also catch occurrences in other parts of the file which
      the static patch would overlook.
  * Shorten persistent identifier for CCW network interfaces (on s390x only).
    (LP: #1526808)
  * debian/rules: If $TEST_UPSTREAM is set (when building/testing upstream
    master instead of distro packages), don't fail on non-installed new files
    or new library symbols.
  * Add systemd-sysv conflict to upstart-sysv, and version the upstart
    conflict. This works with both Debian's and Ubuntu's upstart packages.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop support for the /etc/udev/disabled flag file. This was a workaround
    for udev failing to install with debootstrap because it didn't use
    invoke-rc.d and therefor was not compliant with policy-rc.d. See #520742
    for further details. This is no longer the case, so supporting that file
    only leads to confusion about its purpose.
  * Retrigger cleanup of org.freedesktop.machine1.conf and
    hwclock-save.service now that dpkg has been fixed to correctly pass the
    old version to postinst on upgrade. (Closes: #802545)
  * Only ship *.link files as part of the udev package. The *.network files
    are solely used by systemd-networkd and should therefor be shipped by the
    systemd package. (Closes: #808237)
  * Cherry-pick a few fixes from upstream:
    - Fix unaligned access in initialize_srand(). (Closes: #812928)
    - Don't run kmod-static-nodes.service if module list is empty. This
      requires kmod v23. (Closes: #810367)
    - Fix typo in systemctl(1). (Closes: #807462)
    - Fix systemd-nspawn --link-journal=host to not fail if the directory
      already exists. (Closes: #808222)
    - Fix a typo in logind-dbus.c. The polkit action is named
      org.freedesktop.login1.power-off, not org.freedesktop.login1.poweroff.
    - Don't log an EIO error in gpt-auto-generator if blkid finds something
      which is not a partition table. (Closes: #765586)
    - Apply ACLs to /var/log/journal and also set them explicitly for
      system.journal.
  * Only skip the filesystem check for /usr if the /run/initramfs/fsck-usr
    flag file exists. Otherwise we break booting with dracut which uses
    systemd inside the initramfs. (Closes: #810748)
  * Update the instructions in README.Debian for creating /var/log/journal.
    They are now in line with the documentation in the systemd-journald(8) man
    page and ensure that ACLs and group permissions are properly set.
    (Closes: #800947, #805617)

  * debian/rules: Remove temporary debug output from test failures again. All
    Debian buildd kernels are recent enough now, but add a check for kernels
    older than 3.13 and ignore test failures for those.
  * debian/tests/networkd: Factor out dnsmasq specific test "router" setup, so
    that we can test against other implementations.
  * debian/tests/networkd: Add router setup using an (isolated) networkd
    process for configuring the veths and DHCP server.
  * debian/tests/networkd: On failure, only show journal for current test.
  * systemd-networkd-resolvconf-update.service: Wait for getting a name
    server, not just for getting online.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Wait until bash crash stack trace is in
    the journal before asserting on it. Also relax RE to work on non-x86
    architectures.
  * debian/tests/networkd: If /etc/resolv.conf already has three nameservers,
    accept that too (as then the additional test one can't be added any more).
  * Fix FTBFS on x32. Thanks Helmut Grohne! (Closes: #805910)
  * debian/tests/networkd: For IPv6 tests, also wait for IPv4 address to
    arrive; s-n-wait-online already exits after getting an IPv6 address, but
    we verify both.
  * debian/tests/boot-and-services: Don't check for "Requesting system
    poweroff" log message in nspawn test, current upstream master does not
    write that any more. Instead check for "Stopped Container c1".
  * Add "storage" autopkgtest. Initially this covers some basic use cases with
    LUKS cryptsetup devices.
  * Add acl build dependency (for <!nocheck>). Current upstream master now
    needs it for some test cases.
  * debian/extra/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-bottom/udev: Use "rm -rf"
    instead of "nuke". The latter does not exist any more in current
    initramfs-tools.
  * Ignore test failures during "make check" if /etc/machine-id is missing
    (like in ancient local schroots). (Closes: #807884)

    is already created in 60-cdrom_id.rules.
  * Eliminate "hotplug.functions" udev helper and put the logging functions
    directly into net.agent. This simplifies the migration of the latter to
    ifupdown.
  * Adjust manpages to keep /usr/lib/systemd/{user*,boot,ntp-units.d,modules*}
    paths, only keep /lib/systemd/{system*,network}. (Closes: #808997)
  * debian/udev.README.Debian: Fix typo and slight wording improvement.

    that swap devices are being stopped prematurely during shutdown.
    (Closes: #805133)
  * Drop unneeded /etc/X11/xinit/xinitrc.d/50-systemd-user.sh from the package
    and clean up the conffile on upgrades. We have the dbus-user-session
    package in Debian to properly enable the D-Bus user-session mode which

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * New upstream release:
    - Fix scheduled shutdown to not shut down immediately. (Closes: #797763)
    - Fix description of CPE_NAME in os-release(5). (Closes: #797768)
  * debian/libsystemd0.symbols: Add new symbols from this release.
  * Enable libseccomp support for mips64, mips64el, and x32. (Closes: #797403)
  * debian/tests/networkd: Add hotplug tests.
  * Make networkd call if-up.d/ scripts when it brings up interfaces, to
    become compatible with ifupdown and NetworkManager for packages shipping
    hooks. (LP: #1492129)
    - Add debian/extra/systemd-networkd-dispatcher.c: suid root wrapper for
      calling if-up.d/ or if-post-down.d/ hook scripts. Install it as
      root:systemd-networkd 4754 so that only networkd can run it.
    - Add networkd-call-systemd-networkd-dispatcher-when-links.patch: Call the
      above wrapper when links go up/down.
    - debian/tests/networkd: Verify that if-up.d/ and if-post-down.d/ scripts
      get run for a networkd managed interface.
    - Note that if-pre-up.d/ and if-down.d/ scripts are *not* being called, as
      they are often not applicable for networkd (if-pre-up.d) and unreliable
      (if-down.d).
  * Drop udev-finish. We needed this for the autogenerated CD and network
    interface names, but both are gone now.
  * Drop debian/udev.udev-fallback-graphics.upstart. The vesafb module has
    been compiled into the kernel in both Debian and Ubuntu for a fair while,
    this never had a systemd equivalent, and Debian never shipped the
    accompanying rules for determining $PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY.
  * debian/control: Remove some boilerplate from the long descriptions, to
    more easily get to the point what a specific package actually does.
  * debian/README.Debian: As systemd is the default init now, replace the
    documentation how to switch to systemd with how to switch back
    (temporarily or permanently) to SysV init. Also move that paragraph to the
    bottom as it's now less important.
  * debian/README.Debian: Add a hint why you may want to enable persistent
    journal, and suggest to uninstall system-log-daemon to avoid duplicate
    logging.
  * debian/README.Debian: Add documentation about networkd integration.
  * Rename 01-mac-for-usb.link to 90-mac-for-usb.link so that it becomes
    easier to override.
  * debian-fixup.service just has one purpose now (make /etc/mtab a symlink),
    so drop the debian/extra/debian-fixup shell script and put the ln command
    directly into debian-fixup.service. Update the description.
  * debian/tests/networkd: Check that /etc/resolv.conf gets the DHCP's
    nameserver in case it is a symlink (i. e. dynamically managed by
    systemd-resolved or resolvconf).
  * systemd-networkd-dispatcher: Also pass on the DNS server list to if-up.d/
    as $IF_DNS_NAMESERVERS, so that resolvconf or similar programs work as
    expected.
  * Drop debian/systemd-journal-remote.postrm: Removing system users is
    potentially dangerous (there might be a leftover process after purging).

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Drop libsystemd-login-dev. All reverse dependencies have been updated to
    use libsystemd-dev directly.
  * Update build instructions to use "gbp clone" instead of "gbp-clone" as all

    None of the files in this package were previously shipped by systemd.
  * Create system users for systemd-journal-{gateway,remote,upload} when
    installing the systemd-journal-remote package.
  * Explicitly turn off the features we don't want in a stage1 build.
    Otherwise ./configure might enable them automatically if the build
    dependencies are installed and "dh_install --fail-missing" will then fail
    due to uninstalled files.
  * Enable GnuTLS support as systemd-journal-remote makes sense mostly with
    encryption enabled.
  * Rely on build profiles to determine which packages should be skipped
    during build and no longer specify that manually.
  * Drop our patch which removes rc-local-generator.
    rc-local.service acts as an ordering barrier even if its condition is
    false, because conditions are evaluated when the service is about to be
    started, not when it is enqueued. We don't want this ordering barrier on
    systems that don't need/use /etc/rc.local.

  * debian/extra/initramfs-tools/scripts/init-top/udev: Drop $ROOTDELAY wait.
    This does not concern udev in particular, but is handled by
    initramfs-tools itself (scripts/local). The intention of this parameter is
    not to statically wait for the given time, but wait *up to* that time for
    the root device to appear.
  * Add debian/extra/units/rc-local.service.d/wait-online.conf: Make
    rc-local.service wait for network-online.target (if it gets started). This
    not specified by LSB, but has been behaving that way in Debian under SysV
    init and upstart. (LP: #1451797)
  * Fix parsing of escape characters in Exec*= lines. (Closes: #787256)
  * Drop path_is_mount_point-handle-false-positive-on-some-fs.patch (it was
    already not applied in 220-1). This needs to be re-thought and re-done
    against the current code, and overlayfs in general. On overlayfs this
    still reports false positives for files that changed in the upperdir, but
    this does not break systemd-machine-id-commit any more.
  * Add debian/extra/rules/80-debian-compat.rules, replacing three of our
    patches. These are independent udev rules to change device permissions and
    add CD/DVD symlinks for compatibility with earlier Debian releases.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Bump Depends on util-linux to make sure we have a sulogin implementation
    which properly cleans up its children when emergency.service is restarted.

  * Remove any vestiges of /dev/.udev/. This directory has been replaced by
    /run/udev/ since wheezy.
  * Drop udev migration code from pre-wheezy.

    - Drop all backported patches and port the others to new upstream release.
  * Cherry-pick patch to fix udevd --daemon assertion regression.
  * Cherry-pick patch to fix udevd worker hang.
  * systemd.install: systemd.pc moved back into /usr/share/pkgconfig/.
  * libsystemd0.symbols: Add new symbols from this release.
  * Drop debian/extra/60-keyboard.hwdb for now. Upstream has a newer version,
    and it's not nearly as often updated any more as it used to be.
  * debian/rules: Remove shipped audit_type-to-name.h and
    keyboard-keys-from-name.gperf and regenerate them during build (bug in
    upstream 220 tarball).
  * autopkgtest: Ship/use mock fsck from debian/tests, as it's missing in the
    220 tarball.
  * Add libnss-mymachines binary package. (Closes: #784858)
  * Add libnss-myhostname binary package, taking over from the very old and
    unmaintained standalone source package as per its maintainer's request.
    (Closes: #760514)
  * Drop buildsys-Don-t-default-to-gold-as-the-linker.patch and set LD in
    debian/rules on sparc only. This can be dropped entirely once we build
    GUdev from a separate source.
  * bootchart autopkgtest: Skip test if /proc/schedstat does not exist, i. e.
    the kernel is missing CONFIG_SCHEDSTAT. Bootchart requires this.
  * systemd-fsckd autopkgtest: On Debian plymouth-start stays running, adjust
    was_running() for that.
  * systemd-fsckd autopkgtest: In test_systemd_fsck_with_plymouth_failure(),
    fix plymouthd status check to work under both Debian and Ubuntu.
  * Replace almost all of Fix-paths-in-man-pages.patch with upstreamed
    patches. (The remainder is planned to get fixed upstream as well.)
  * Remove our update-rc.d patches, replace them with upstream patches for
    /lib/systemd/systemd-sysv-install abstraction, and provide one for
    update-rc.d. Also implement "is-enabled" command by directly checking for
    the presence of rcS or rc5 symlinks. (Closes: #760616)
  * Fix path_is_mount_point for files (regression in 220).
  * debian/control: Drop obsolete XS-Testsuite:, dpkg adds it automatically.
  * Use Ubuntu's default NTP server for timesyncd when building on Ubuntu.

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Remove /var/run and /var/lock migration code from debian-fixup. The /run
    migration was completed in wheezy so this is no longer necessary.
  * Drop our versioned Depends on initscripts. This was initially added for
    the /run migration and later to ensure we have a mountnfs hook which
    doesn't cause a deadlock under systemd. The /run migration was completed
    in wheezy and jessie ships a fixed mountnfs hook. In addition we now use
    the ignore-dependencies job mode in our lsb init-functions hook, so it's
    safe to drop this dependency.
  * Stop building gudev packages. Upstream has moved the gudev code into a
    separate repository which is now managed on gnome.org. The gudev packages
    will be built from src:libgudev from now on. See also

    and Avoid-reloading-services-when-shutting-down.patch: This was fixed more
    robustly in invoke-rc.d and service now, see #777113.
  * debian/tests/boot-smoke: Allow 10 seconds for systemd jobs to settle down.
  * Fix "tentative" state of devices which are not in /dev (mostly in
    containers), and avoid overzealous cleanup unmounting of mounts from them.
    (LP: #1444402)
  * debian/extra/udev-helpers/net.agent: Eliminate cat and most grep calls.
  * Drop Set-default-polling-interval-on-removable-devices-as.patch; it's long
    obsolete, CD ejection with the hardware button works properly without it.
  * Re-enable-journal-forwarding-to-syslog.patch: Update patch description,
    journal.conf.d/ exists now.
  * journal: Gracefully handle failure to bind to audit socket, which is known
    to fail in namespaces (containers) with current kernels. Also
    conditionalize systemd-journald-audit.socket on CAP_AUDIT_READ.
    (LP: #1457054)
  * Put back *.agent scripts and use net.agent in Ubuntu. This fixes escaping
    of unit names, reduces the delta, and will make it easier to get a common
    solution for integrating ifup.d/ scripts with networkd.
  * When booting with "quiet", run the initramfs' udevd with "notice" log
    level. (LP: #1432171)
  * Add sigpwr-container-shutdown.service: Power off when receiving SIGPWR in
    a container. This makes lxc-stop work for systemd containers.

  * Revert "Make apparmor run before networking". This causes dependency
    cycles while apparmor still depends on $remote_fs.

  * debian/tests/logind: With dropped systemd-logind-launch we don't have a
    visible /sys/fs/cgroup/systemd/ any more under cgmanager. So adjust the
    test to check /proc/self/cgroup instead.
  * Add unit-config autopkgtest to check systemd unit/sysv init enabling and
    disabling via systemctl. This also reproduces #777613.
  * systemctl: Always install/enable/disable native units, even if there is a
    corresponding SysV script and we call update-rc.d; while the latter
    handles WantedBy=, it does not handle Alias=. (Closes: #777613)
  * cgroup: Don't trim cgroup trees created by someone else, just the ones
    that systemd itself created. This avoids cleaning up empty cgroups from
    e.g. LXC. (Closes: #777601)
  * Don't parse /etc/mtab for current mounts, but /proc/self/mountinfo. If the
    former is a file, it's most likely outdated on boot, leading to race
    conditions and unmounts during boot. (LP: #1419623)

  * Explicitly disable the features we don't want to build for those with
    autodetection. This ensures reliable build results in dirty build
    environments.

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * boot-and-services autopkgtest: Ensure that there are no failed units,
    except possibly systemd-modules-load.service (as that notoriously fails
    with cruft in /etc/modules).
  * Revert "input" system group creation in systemd.postinst from 218-7. It's
    already done in udev.postinst.
  * ifup@.service: Revert checking for existance of ifupdown config for that
    interface, net.agent already does that.
  * Drop Also-redirect-to-update-rc.d-when-not-using-.service.patch; not
    necessary any more with the current version (mangle_names() already takes
    care of this).
  * Merge into Add-support-for-rcS.d-init-scripts-to-the-sysv-gener.patch:
    - Do-not-order-rcS.d-services-after-local-fs.target-if.patch, as it
      partially reverts the above, and is just fixing it.
    - Map-rcS.d-init-script-dependencies-to-their-systemd-.patch as it's just
      adding some missing functionality for the same purpose.
  * Merge Run-update-rc.d-defaults-before-update-rc.d-enable-d.patch into
    Make-systemctl-enable-disable-call-update-rc.d-for-s.patch as the former
    is fixing the latter and is not an independent change.
  * Drop Launch-logind-via-a-shell-wrapper.patch and systemd-logind-launch
    wrapper. The only remaining thing that we need from it is to create
    /run/systemd/, move that into the D-BUS service file directly.
  * /lib/lsb/init-functions.d/40-systemd: Avoid deadlocks during bootup and
    shutdown. DHCP/ifupdown and similar hooks which call "/etc/init.d/foo
    reload" can easily cause deadlocks, since the synchronous wait plus
    systemd's normal behaviour of transactionally processing all dependencies
    first easily causes dependency loops. Thus during boot/shutdown operate
    only on the unit and not on its dependencies, just like SysV behaves.
    (Closes: #777115, LP: #1417010)
  * Only start logind if dbus is installed. This fixes the noisy startup
    failure in environments without dbus, such as LXC containers or servers.
    (part of #772700)
  * Add getty-static.service unit which starts getty@.service on tty 2 to 6 if
    dbus is not installed, and hence logind cannot auto-start them on demand.
    (Closes: #772700)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Update insserv-generator and map $x-display-manager to
    display-manager.service, following the recent change in sysv-generator.
    This avoids creating references to a no longer existing
    x-display-manager.target unit.

  * Drop logger.agent. It hasn't been called from any udev rule for a long
    time, and looks obsolete.
  * debian/rules: Configure with --disable-firstboot to replace some manual
    file removals.
  * debian/rules: Remove manual file installation, move them to
    debian/*.install. Move all Debian specific installed files to
    debian/extra/.
  * Merge some changes from the Ubuntu package to reduce the delta; these only
    apply when building on/for Ubuntu:
    - Add 40-hyperv-hotadd.rules: Workaround for LP: #1233466.
    - Add 61-persistent-storage-android.rules to create persistent symlinks
      for partitions with PARTNAME. By Ricardo Salveti.
    - Add 71-power-switch-proliant.rules for supporting the power switches of
      ProLiant Server Cartridges. By Dann Frazier.
    - Add 78-graphics-card.rules: Mark KMS capable graphics devices as
      PRIMARY_DEVICE_FOR_DISPLAY so that we can wait for those in plymouth.
      By Scott James Remnant.
    - Don't install the Debian *.agent scripts. Instead, have Ubuntu's
      80-networking.rules directly pull in ifup@.service, which is much easier
      and more efficient.
  * Make EPERM/EACCESS when applying OOM adjustment for forked processes
    non-fatal. This happens in user namespaces like unprivileged LXC
    containers.
  * Fix assertion failure due to /dev/urandom being unmounted when shutting
    down unprivileged containers. Thanks Stéphane Graber.
  * Enable EFI support. This mostly auto-mounts /sys/firmware/efi/efivars, but
    also provides a generator for auto-detecting the root and the /boot/efi
    partition if they aren't in /etc/fstab. (Closes: #773533)

  * sysv-generator: handle Provides: for non-virtual facility names.
    (Closes: #774335)
  * Fix systemd-remount-fs.service to not fail on remounting /usr if /usr
    isn't mounted yet. This happens with initramfs-tools < 0.118 which we
    might not get into Jessie any more. (Closes: #742048)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * fstab-generator: Handle mountall's non-standard "nobootwait" and
    "optional" options. ("bootwait" is already the systemd default behaviour,
    and "showthrough" is irrelevant here, so both can be ignored).
  * Add autopkgtest for one-time boot with upstart when systemd-sysv is
    installed. This test only works under Ubuntu which has a split out
    upstart-bin package, and will be skipped under Debian.
  * debian/ifup@.service: Check if ifup succeeds by calling ifquery, to
    work around ifup not failing on invalid interfaces (see #773539)
  * debian/ifup@.service: Set proper service type (oneshot).
  * sysv-generator: Handle .sh suffixes when translating Provides:.
    (Closes: #775889)
  * sysv-generator: Make real units overwrite symlinks generated by Provides:
    from other units. Fixes failures due to presence of backup or old init.d
    scripts. (Closes: #775404)
  * Fix journal forwarding to syslog in containers without CAP_SYS_ADMIN.
    (Closes: #775067)
  * Re-enable AppArmor support, now that libapparmor1 moved to /lib. Add
    versioned dependency as long as this is still only in experimental.
    (Closes: #775331)
  * Add some missing dpkg and ucf temp files to the "hidden file" filter, to
    e. g. avoid creating units for them through the sysv-generator.
    (Closes: #775903)
  * Silence useless warning about /etc/localtime not being a symlink. This is
    deliberate in Debian with /usr (possibly) being on a separate partition.
    (LP: #1409594)

  [ Christian Kastner ]
  * Use common-session-noninteractive in systemd-user's PAM config, instead of
    common-session. The latter can include PAM modules like libpam-mount which
    expect to be called just once and/or interactively, which already happens
    for login, ssh, or the display-manager. Add pam_systemd.so explicitly, as
    it's not included in -noninteractive, but is always required (and
    idempotent). There is no net change on systemd which don't use manually
    installed PAM modules. (Closes: #739676)

  [ Michael Biebl ]
  * Make sure we run debian-fixup.service after /var has been mounted if /var
    is on a separate partition. Otherwise we might end up creating the

  * Add debian/extra/systemd-vconsole-setup.service dependency shim for
    the console-setup init script, to avoid breaking dependencies of
    third-party packages. Install it for Ubuntu only for now, as in Debian
    plymouth's unit got adjusted. (LP: #1392970, Debian #755194)

  * Use dh_installinit's --noscript instead of --no-start for the upstart
    jobs without sysvinit scripts (thanks lintian).
  * Put systemd.pc into arch specific pkgconfig dir, as it contains the arch
    specific libdir value.
  * Don't enable audit by default. It causes flooding of dmesg and syslog,
    suppressing actually important messages. (Closes: #773528)

    the kernel that userspace firmware loading failed. Otherwise it tries for a
    minute to call the userspace helper (if CONFIG_FW_LOADER_USER_HELPER is
    enabled) in vain, which causes long delays with devices which have a range
    of possible firmware versions. (LP: #1398458)
  * debian/systemd.postinst: Don't always restart journald, as this currently
    can't be done without losing the current journal and breaking attached
    processes. So only restart it from upgrades < 215-3 (where the socket
    location got moved) as an one-time upgrade path from wheezy.
    (Closes: #771122)
  * Revert "Modify insserv generator to mask sysvinit-only display managers".
    This is still under dispute, a bit risky, and might get a different

  * Actually install udev's README.Debian when building for Debian.

    (part of #772700)
  * Add getty-static.service unit which starts getty@.service on tty 2 to 6 if

  * Switch back to load the sg module via the kmod builtin. The problem was

  * Drop "-b debian" from Vcs-Git since we use the master branch for
    packaging now.
  * Drop Conflicts: sysvinit (<< 2.88dsf-44~) from systemd-sysv since this
    breaks dist-upgrades from wheezy when switching from sysvinit to
    systemd-sysv as default init. While downgrading the Pre-Depends in
    sysvinit would have been an alternative, dropping the Conflicts and only
    keeping the Replaces was deemed the lesser evil. (Closes: #748355)
  * Use Conflicts instead of Breaks against sysvinit-core. This avoids
    /sbin/init going missing when switching from systemd-sysv to sysvinit.
    While at it, add a Replaces: upstart. (Closes: #751589)
  * Make the SysV compat tools try both /run/initctl and /dev/initctl. This
    makes them usable under sysvinit as PID 1 without requiring any symlinks.
  * Various ifupdown integration fixes
    - Use DefaultDependencies=no in ifup@.service so the service can be

  * Create a few compat symlinks for the udev package, most notably
    /sbin/udevadm and /sbin/udevd.
  * Remove the dpkg-triggered debian-enable-units script. This was a temporary

    upgrades.
  * Simplify the udev SysV init script and remove experimental and obsolete
    features.
  * Revert upstream commits which dropped support for distro specific
    features and config files.
  * Make logind, hostnamed, localed and timedated D-Bus activatable and
    usable when systemd is not running.
  * Store hwdb binary database in /lib/udev, not /etc/udev. Create the file on

  * Provide a dpkg file trigger for hwdb, so the database is automatically
    updated when packages install files into /lib/udev/hwdb.d.
