Subject: Fix FTBFS on GNU/kFreeBSD (and likely Gnu/Hurd)
Forwarded: yes
Origin: vendor

The original failure [1] was caused by the fact that cxxabi.h execinfo.h etc.
includes where guarded more restrictively (e.g. additionally by  __linux) than
the code which needs them (just by e.g.
KWSYS_SYSTEMINFORMATION_HAS_CPP_DEMANGLE).  kFreeGNU has some of these headers
hence extend __linux ifdef to kFreeBSD and GNU Hurd as well.

Ideally, the code should be fixed to have the same level of ifdef protection in
all places.
