Debian Cryptsetup Initramfs integration
=======================================

1. Introduction
---------------

Kernels more recent than 2.6.12 have dropped support for devfs, which
means that initrd-tools can no longer be used to boot into an encrypted
root partition. Instead, a similar functionality has been developed for
use with an initramfs-image.


2. A fresh installation
-----------------------

If you plan to perform a completely new installation of Debian onto a
machine and to do so using an encrypted root partition, you might want
to consider using a version of Debian Installer with partman-crypto
(see https://wiki.debian.org/DebianInstaller/PartmanCrypto).

The installation will then take care of all the details and perform the
necessary configuration for you, meaning that you should not have to
read the rest of this document to get a machine with an encrypted
root filesystem up and running.

However, if you are not planning to perform a new installation from scratch,
the following information might be useful to you.


3. Requirements
---------------

In order to boot from an encrypted root filesystem, you need an
initramfs-image which includes the necessary kernel modules and scripts to
setup the root device after the kernel has been initialized, but before the
rest of the operating system is booted.

To do so, you need two partitions:
* an unencrypted `/boot` partition
* an encrypted `/` partition

In addition, you need to have both initramfs-tools and busybox installed.

NOTE: You should make sure that your swap partition is either encrypted, or
that you are using a swap file on an encrypted partition, as crypto keys and
other sensitive information might otherwise be written out to the swap
partition in unencrypted form.


4. Setup (regular dm-crypt)
---------------------------

First of all, you must edit `/etc/crypttab` and add a line describing your
root device, for example:

    cryptroot /dev/sda2 none cipher=aes-xts-plain64,size=256,hash=sha1

This will allow cryptsetup to create `/dev/mapper/cryptroot` from the
encrypted partition `/dev/sda2` during boot.

In addition, you must also make sure that the root device is listed in
`/etc/fstab`, for example:

    /dev/mapper/cryptroot / ext4 defaults 0 1

This will allow the initramfs support scripts to know which of the devices
in the crypttab that is the root device.

After doing these changes, you should regenerate the initramfs by running
`update-initramfs -u`, then make sure that your boot loader is configured
to feed the initramfs to the kernel when booting. The kernel root argument
should also be changed to `/dev/mapper/cryptroot`.

Now, reboot the machine, and if everything is correctly configured, you
should be given a prompt to type in the passphrase for the encrypted
root partition before the boot can continue.

NOTE: In order to ensure that the crypto setup works in a consistent
manner, you should make sure that the hash function is specified in the
/etc/crypttab file if you are using regular dm-crypt (with LUKS the hash
function to use is stored in the LUKS header).


5. Setup (using LUKS)
---------------------

If you are using the LUKS feature of cryptsetup, the above setup recipe should
still apply, but since most options can be derived from the information stored
in the LUKS header on-disk, the line to add to `/etc/crypttab` should look
something like this:

    cryptroot /dev/sda2 none luks,discard


6. Exotic key types
-------------------

The above examples assume that you use a regular passphrase as the key to the
encrypted filesystem. However, if you wish to make use of more complex setups
(such as root-key-on-usb-memory), you can create a script which does all the
steps necessary to retrieve the key and then prints it to stdout.

Then add a `keyscript=/path/to/your/script.sh` to the options (fourth column)
in the above mentioned `/etc/crypttab` line, so that it looks something like
this:

    cryptroot /dev/sda2 none luks,discard,keyscript=/usr/local/sbin/cryptkey

Next, regenerate your initramfs image. This will copy the script into the
initramfs image under the `/lib/cryptsetup/keyscripts/` directory.

NOTE: there is a limited set of tools available when the script is executing
as part of the initramfs bootup, you have to make sure that you do not use
any tools which are not available or your script, and therefore boot, will
fail.


7. "cryptopts" boot argument
----------------------------

In general, you should use the above approach with a line describing your
root partition in `/etc/crypttab` and `/etc/fstab`. However, if for some
reason you wish to override the settings that are derived from these files
and stored in the initramfs image, you can use the "cryptopts" boot argument
(this *only* works for the root partition).

The format of cryptopts is:

    cryptopts=<opt1>=<value1>,<opt2>=<value2>...

Beside the `hash`, `size`, `cipher` and `lvm` options that correspond to the
same options in the fourth field of /etc/crypttab, the options `target`,
`source` and `key` are also supported. They correspond to the first, second
and third field of /etc/crypttab, respectively. See the crypttab man page
for further details.

Several `cryptopts` boot arguments can also be specified in case more than
one mapping needs to be setup in the initramfs stage of the boot.

Example boot arguments:

    root=/dev/mapper/crypt0 cryptopts=target=crypt0,source=/dev/sda1,cipher=aes-xts-plain64,size=256,hash=sha1

In particular, if all `cryptopts` boot arguments have an empty value
then no mapping is setup.  This can be used to disable the cryptsetup
initramfs scripts for a particular boot.

8. Resume device support
------------------------

The initramfs scripts will also try to automatically determine the devices,
if any, that are used for software suspend (swsusp, suspend2 or uswsusp) and
to set them up during the initramfs stage in order to allow suspend and resume
in combination with encryption to keep the resume image safe from potential
attackers.

If your resume device and your root partition use two different cryptsetup
mappings, you might want to use the `decrypt_derived` keyscript as described
below.

9. The `decrypt_derived` keyscript
----------------------------------

Assume that you have two entries in `/etc/crypttab`:

    cryptroot /dev/sda1 none luks,discard
    cryptswap /dev/sda2 none luks

If cryptswap is used as your suspend/resume device, you'd normally need to
enter two different passphrases during the boot, but the `decrypt_derived`
script can generate the key for the second mapping using a hash of the key
for the first mapping.

In short, you'll need to do something like the following to take advantage
of the decrypt_derived script:

1. `swapoff -a`
2. `cryptsetup luksClose cryptswap`
3. edit `/etc/crypttab` and change the cryptswap line to e.g.:
   `cryptswap /dev/sda2 cryptroot cipher=aes-xts-plain65,size=256,hash=sha1,keyscript=decrypt_derived,swap`
4. `cryptdisks_start cryptswap`
5. Make sure that `/dev/mapper/cryptswap` has been created
6. `swapon -a`
7. (optional) `update-initramfs -u`

After you've followed the above steps, your swap device should be setup
automatically after the root device has been setup during the boot stage.

WARNING: If you use the decrypt_derived keyscript for devices with persistent
data (i.e. not swap or temp devices), then you will lose access to that data
permanently if something damages the LUKS header of the LUKS device you derive
from. The same applies if you luksFormat the device, even if you use the same
passphrase(s). A LUKS header backup, or better a backup of the data on the
derived device may be a good idea. See the Cryptsetup FAQ on how to do this
right.

Note: The decrypt_derived keyscript won't work when the volume key of the
device being derived from is offloaded to the kernel keyring service (thus not
readable by userspace). That behavior is the default for LUKS2 devices (unless
opened with the `--disable-keyring` option) since Linux 4.10. For such devices,
an alternative is to use the same passphrase and unlock the source device using
the `decrypt_keyctl` keyscript.

Note: If you don't use suspend device support, it's better to use completely
random keys for your encrypted swap device. See the section '2. Encrypted
swap partition(s)' in `/usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/README.Debian` for information
on how to setup this.

10. The `passdev` keyscript
----------------------------

If you have a keyfile on a removable device (e.g. a USB-key), you can use the
passdev keyscript. It will wait for the device to appear, mount it read-only,
read the key and then unmount the device.

The `key` part of `/etc/crypttab` will be interpreted as `<device>:<path>[:<timeout>]`,
it is strongly recommended that you use one of the persistent device names from
`/dev/disk/*`, e.g. `/dev/disk/by-label/myusbkey`.

This is an example of a suitable line in cryptsetup:

    cryptroot /dev/sda2 /dev/disk/by-label/myusbkey:/keys/root.key discard,cipher=aes-xts-plain64,size=256,hash=sha1,keyscript=passdev

The above line would cause the boot to pause until `/dev/disk/by-label/myusbkey`
appears in the fs, then mount that device and use the file `/keys/root.key`
on the device as the key (without any hashing) as the key for the fs.

The timeout option has to be in seconds.

If any modules are required in order to mount the filesystem on the removable
device, then initramfs-tools needs to be configured to add these modules to
the initramfs. This can be done by listing the required modules in
`/etc/initramfs-tools/modules`.

11. Limitation: renaming of target name for encrypted root device
-----------------------------------------------------------------

As spotted by Adam Lee in bug report [#671037], it's not possible to simply
rename the target name for encrypted root devices. It breaks the initramfs
creation process. The bug report submitter found a solution to work around
this limitation:

0. enter another system (like livecd)
1. open luks device with the new name, change the target name to the new one
2. chroot into it (now, the current target name is the same as it in conf)
3. `update-initramfs -u`
4. reboot

12. Storing keyfiles directly in the initrd
-------------------------------------------

Normally devices using a keyfile are ignored (with a loud warning), and
the key file itself is not included in the initrd, because the initramfs
image typically lives on an unencrypted `/boot` partition. However in
some cases it is desirable to include the key file in the initrd; for
instance recent versions of GRUB support booting from encrypted block
devices, allowing an encrypted `/boot` partition.

Among the key files listed in the crypttab(5), those matching the value
of the environment variable KEYFILE_PATTERN (interpreted as a shell
pattern) will be included in the initramfs image. For instance if
`/etc/crypttab` lists two key files `/etc/keys/{root,swap}.key`, you can
add the following to `/etc/cryptsetup-initramfs/conf-hook` to add them to
the initrd.

    KEYFILE_PATTERN="/etc/keys/*.key"

Furthermore if the initramfs image is to include private key material,
you'll want to create it with a restrictive umask in order to keep
non-privileged users at bay.  This can be achieved by adding the
following to `/etc/initramfs-tools/initramfs.conf`.
