# WARNING: If you use the decrypt_derived keyscript for devices with
# persistent data (i.e. not swap or temp devices), then you will lose
# access to that data permanently if something damages the LUKS header
# of the LUKS device you derive from. The same applies if you luksFormat
# the device, even if you use the same passphrase(s). A LUKS header
# backup, or better a backup of the data on the derived device may be
# a good idea. See the Cryptsetup FAQ on how to do this right.
