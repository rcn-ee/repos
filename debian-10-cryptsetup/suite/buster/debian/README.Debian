1. Introduction into Cryptsetup for Debian
------------------------------------------

 Cryptsetup is a command-line interface for configuring encrypted block
devices via dm-crypt, a kernel device-mapper target. For documentation about
the cryptsetup tool, see manpage of cryptsetup(8) and the frequently asked
questions at `/usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/FAQ.gz`.

 The Debian cryptsetup package provides the initscript `/etc/init.d/cryptdisks`
and a configuration file `/etc/crypttab` for automatically configuring encrypted
devices at boot time. The applications cryptdisks_start and cryptdisks_stop
are provided to process crypttab configured devices manually. See the manpages
of crypttab(5), cryptdisks_start(8) and cryptdisks_stop(8) for more information.

 The luksformat script provides a simple interface for creating an encrypted
device that follows the LUKS standard and for putting a file system onto the
encrypted device. See man luksformat(8) for more information.

 If you wish to perform a Debian installation to an encrypted root, you might
be interested in using a version of Debian Installer with partman-crypto,
which will install the system and setup cryptsetup and initramfs-tools.

 For instructions about how to encrypt your root filesystem and integrate
cryptsetup into initramfs on a running system, see
`/usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/README.initramfs.gz`.


2. Encrypted swap partition(s)
------------------------------

 An encrypted swap partition prevents spying on plaintext secrets (passwords)
that may be written to disk when memory is swapped to disk.

 To encrypt your swap partitions, you'll first have to deactivate your swap:

    swapoff -a

 You'll have to add an entry for every swap partition in `/etc/crypttab`. Be
sure to place the source device (here `/dev/sde9`) with your swap devices:

    # <target name> <source device> <key file>      <options>
    cswap1          /dev/sde9       /dev/urandom    swap,cipher=aes-xts-plain64,size=256,hash=sha1

 Now you need to change the swap devices in `/etc/fstab` to the encrypted swap
device names (`/dev/mapper/cswap1` in this example).

    # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>     <dump>  <pass>
    /dev/sde9        none           swap    sw            0       0

becomes

    # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>     <dump>  <pass>
    /dev/mapper/cswap1  none        swap    sw            0       0

 Then, you need to start the cryptsetup swap devices and reactivate swap:

    cryptdisks_start cswap1
    swapon -a

 And finally, if `/dev/sde9` was previously used as resume device, you should
disable it (the new swap partition is mapped with a non-persistent key hence
can't be used for resuming after suspend to disk).  With initramfs-tools 0.130
and later, this can be done with

    echo "RESUME=none" >/etc/initramfs-tools/conf.d/resume
    update-initramfs -u

 That's it! You have a crypted swap device. Note that `/dev/urandom` provides
only pseudo-random entropy. So if you're paranoid rather use `/dev/random` as
source for random data. Be aware though that `/dev/random` might not provide
enough random bytes for your key, causing your system to hang at boot, waiting
for more entropy. Moving mouse and keyboard typing might help in this case.

 Read the crypttab(5) manpage for more information, for example options to use
a different encryption algorithm than the default.


3. Insecure mode/owner for keys
-------------------------------

 Any key that is stored somewhere to be used with cryptsetup should have the
mode 400 (`-r--------`) and root as owner/group. `chown root.root keyfile` and
`chmod 400 keyfile` will do the trick for you.

 If a key is stored on a vfat filesystem (very common for removable media),
chmod and chown will not work. The vfat filesystem (and several others too)
does not support file permissions and ownership. Instead, you should use the
uid, gid and umask options in `/etc/fstab` to ensure secure permissions for
the key.

 As an example, assume that `/dev/sdg8` is the removable media containing
keyfiles on a vfat filesystem and that it is going to be mounted on
`/media/flash0`. The configuration in `/etc/fstab` should then be something
like this:

    # <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>               <dump>  <pass>
    /dev/sdg8       /media/flash0   vfat    uid=0,gid=0,umask=277   0       0

 If you are using udev, it might be a good idea to use the `/dev/disk/by-label`
links instead of `/dev/sdg8` as the link will work no matter in which order the
media is inserted and detected.


4. Cryptsetup and udev
----------------------

 As a workaround for some yet-to-be-fixed race condition in kernel,
device-mapper or udev, cryptsetup currently runs udevsettle.

 This leads to problems if you invoke cryptsetup as part of a udev rule.
udevsettle waits until queued kernel/udev events are processed and the
"run programs" have finished. Due to cryptsetup itself being a "run
program" in this case, this ends in a deadlock.

 Therefore cryptsetup should be detached directly after invocation in this
case, so that it runs asynchronously.


5. Useful keyscripts: askpass and passdev
-----------------------------------------

 The cryptsetup package ships with several keyscripts. Keyscripts may be
configured in `/etc/crypttab` in order to provide the key required to unlock
the device. The shipped keyscripts are located at `/lib/cryptsetup/scripts`.

 Some keyscripts have an own README file at `/usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/`.

 Two special keyscripts, worth being mentioned here, are askpass and passdev.

 Askpass is located at `/lib/cryptsetup/askpass`. It's a simple helper program
that supports different methods (console, fifo, splashy, ...) to prompt for a
passphrase, and prints the result to stdout. The syntax is:

    /lib/cryptsetup/askpass PROMPT

 Passdev will wait for a given device to appear, mount it read-only, read the
key, and unmount the device. See `/usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/README.initramfs.gz`
for more information about passdev.


6. The `check` option
---------------------

 The `check` option in crypttab allows one to configure checks to be run
against the target device after cryptsetup has been invoked.
The default check `blkid` can check for any known filesystem type, as it uses
blkid from util-linux. you can check for a particular filesystem by giving for
example `checkargs=ext4` or `checkargs=swap` as an option in `/etc/crypttab`.

 Please send us your checks, if you write new ones. If they are generally
useful, we will include them in the package.

 See man crypttab(5) for more information about the checksystem.


7. Cryptsetup and Splashy
-------------------------

 Splashy support in cryptsetup is currently somehow limited. Splashy is known
to freeze at the password dialog for encrypted non-root filesystems. Only the
password dialog for the encrypted root filesystem works.

 It seems like splashy freezes for any input dialog in initscripts while
input dialogs at initramfs stage seem to work. This leads to the assumption
that the bug is somewhere in splashy and neither in cryptsetups initscripts
nor in askpass.


8. Remotely unlock encrypted rootfs
-----------------------------------

 Thanks to Chris <debian@x.ray.net> it's possible to install a dropbear SSH
server into the initramfs, connect to this SSH server during execution of
initramfs early in the boot process, and unlock encrypted devices - even
the root device - before the boot process continues. (Note that in order
to force an arbitrary device to be processed at initramfs stage you
might need to set the `initramfs` option in its crypttab entry; see
crypttab(5) for details.)

 This way it is possible to use an encrypted root filesystem on headless
systems where no physical access is available during boot process.

 Dropbear 0.52-1 or later is required for this to work. (Since 2015.68-1 the
functionality has its own binary package `dropbear-initramfs`.) Consult
`/usr/share/doc/dropbear-initramfs/README.initramfs` from the dropbear-initramfs
package for information how to install and configure the dropbear SSH server
into the initramfs.

 You can then unlock the disk remotely via SSH with

    ssh -tF ~/.luks/ssh.conf root@remote.system.com cryptroot-unlock

 Or, using a local gpg-encrypted key file:

    gpg --decrypt ~/.luks/remote.key.gpg | ssh -TF ~/.luks/ssh.conf root@remote.system.com cryptroot-unlock

 When its standard input is a TTY, `cryptroot-unlock` keeps prompting for
passphrases until there are no more devices to unlock; otherwise you'll
need to invoke it as many times as there are devices to unlock.

 That's it. Now that all required encrypted devices are unlocked, the
remote system should continue with the boot process.

 You can also use the following authorized_keys(5) options in
`/etc/dropbear-initramfs/authorized_keys` to restrict access and avoid
users poking around:

    no-port-forwarding,no-agent-forwarding,no-X11-forwarding,command="/bin/cryptroot-unlock" ssh-rsa ...

(Be sure to rebuild the initrd afterwards: `update-initramfs -u -k all`)


9. Backup the LUKS header
-------------------------

 WARNING: This information might be outdated. Please read the cryptsetup FAQ
at `/usr/share/doc/cryptsetup/FAQ.gz` for up-to-date information on how to
backup the LUKS header.

 The LUKS header is located at the beginning of every LUKS encrypted device.
It stores information such as used cipher, hash, etc. But most importantly,
the header contains eight keyslots, which do keep an encrypted version of the
LUKS masterkey. the data on an encrypted LUKS partition is encrypted with this
masterkey. thus, there's no way to restore the data once the masterkey is
lost. For that reason, one might want to backup the LUKS header in order to
prevent accidental data loss.

 On the other hand keeping a backup of the LUKS header isn't recommended for
security reasons. The reason is, that LUKS was designed with key revocation in
mind. Once the LUKS header is copied to a backup, revoking a (possibly
compromised) passphrase or keyfile from the keyslot isn't enough anymore. the
revoked passphrase/keyfile can easily be reactived by writing back the header
backup to the device.

 Beginning with version 1.1.0, cryptsetup has support for the commands
luksHeaderBackup and luksHeaderRestore. If you want to store a backup of your
LUKS header with the mentioned drawbacks in mind, do the following:

 Prepare a ramdisk to store the backup temporarely. You should do that in order
to prevent any hardware caching functions or filesystem jounals to copy the
backup around to places you cannot control. If you want to store the backup
permanently, write it to a read-only medium like CD immediately from ramdisk,
without your burning program writing an intermediate image to some temp dir.

 To actually backup the header, use the following command:

    cryptsetup luksHeaderBackup <luks-device> --header-backup-file <destination-on-ramdisk>

 That's it. But once again, keep in mind all the security implications when
doing LUKS header backups. In general it's better to backup the data from
encrypted LUKS devices to another encrypted LUKS device. That way you can
manage the keyslots for both original and backup device independently.


10. Changing the boot order of cryptdisks init scripts
-----------------------------------------------------

 In order to support non-standard setups, it might be necessary to change the
order of init scripts in the boot process. Cryptsetup already installs two
init scripts, cryptdisks-early and cryptdisks, in order to support some complex
setups. For example, both "lvm on luks" and "luks on lvm" are supported that
way.

 If your system isn't supported by the default order of init scripts in the
boot process, you need to change the boot process on your own. In some cases
it might be enough to change the LSB dependency headers at initscripts, see
`/etc/init.d/README` for more information about that. For more complex setups,
more intrusive changes are required. For example, adding a third cryptdisks
init script might help. See the log of bugreport [#576646] and [discussion on
debian-devel] for further information.

11. Unlocking LUKS devices from GRUB
------------------------------------

GRUB has been able to unlock LUKS1 devices since early in Jessie's
release cycle.  This feature removes the need for a separate cleartext
/boot partition, hence enables "real" full disk encryption.  However
cryptsetup >=2.1 uses LUKS version 2 by default, which GRUB 2.02
currently doesn't support.  In other words, it is currently not possible
to unlock new LUKS devices formatted with the default parameters from
GRUB.

Neither Jessie nor Stretch's installer supports that feature, and users
already had to implement various work-around to enable it.  Existing
work-arounds won't work anymore with LUKS2.  Integration between LUKS
and GRUB is documented at
<https://cryptsetup-team.pages.debian.net/cryptsetup/encrypted-boot.html>,
including recipes to enable the feature starting from the usual
"encrypted LVM" partitioning method of the Debian Installer -- both with
LUKS1 (pre-Buster) and LUKS2 (Buster and later) devices.
