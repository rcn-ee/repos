Description: C library for interacting with Linux GPIO device - static libraries and headers
 libgpiod encapsulates the ioctl calls and data structures
 behind a straightforward API. This new character device
 interface guarantees all allocated resources are freed after
 closing the device file descriptor and adds several new
 features that are not present in the obsolete sysfs interface
 (like event polling, setting/reading multiple values at once or
 open-source and open-drain GPIOs).
 .
 This package contains the required static libraries, headers, and C++ bindings.
