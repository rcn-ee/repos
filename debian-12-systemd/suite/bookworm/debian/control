Description: system and service manager
 systemd is a system and service manager for Linux. It provides aggressive
 parallelization capabilities, uses socket and D-Bus activation for starting
 services, offers on-demand starting of daemons, keeps track of processes using
 Linux control groups, maintains mount and automount points and implements an
 elaborate transactional dependency-based service control logic.
 .
 Installing the systemd package will not switch your init system unless you
 boot with init=/lib/systemd/systemd or install systemd-sysv in addition.

Description: nss module providing fallback resolution for the current hostname
 This package contains a plugin for the Name Service Switch, providing host
 name resolution for the locally configured system hostname as returned by
 gethostname(2). It returns all locally configured public IP addresses or -- if
 none are configured, the IPv4 address 127.0.1.1 (which is on the local
 loopback) and the IPv6 address ::1 (which is the local host).
 .
 A lot of software relies on that the local host name is resolvable. This
 package provides an alternative to the fragile and error-prone manual editing
 of /etc/hosts.
 .
 Installing this package automatically adds myhostname to /etc/nsswitch.conf.

 nss-mymachines is a plugin for the GNU Name Service Switch (NSS) functionality
 of the GNU C Library (glibc) providing hostname resolution for local containers
 that are registered with systemd-machined.service(8). The container names are
 resolved to IP addresses of the specific container, ordered by their scope.
