config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	tristate "RT-Socket-CAN, CAN raw socket interface"
	help
	RT-Socket-CAN is a real-time socket interface for CAN controllers.

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_DEBUG
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN && PROC_FS
	bool "Enable debug output"
	default y
	help

	This option activates debugging checks and enhanced output for the
	RT-Socket-CAN driver. It also allows to list the hardware registers
	of the registered CAN controllers. It is a recommended option for
	getting started and analysing potential problems. For production
	purposes, it should be switched off (for the sake of latency).

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_LOOPBACK
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	bool "Enable TX loopback to local sockets"
	default n
	help

	This options adds support for TX loopback to local sockets. Normally,
	messages sent to the CAN bus are not visible to sockets listening to
	the same local device. When this option is enabled, TX messages are
	looped back locally when the transmit has been done by default. This
	behaviour can be deactivated or reactivated with "setsockopt". Enable
	this option, if you want to have a "net-alike" behaviour.

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_RXBUF_SIZE
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	int "Size of receive ring buffers (must be 2^N)"
	default 1024

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_MAX_DEVICES
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	int "Maximum number of devices"
	default 4

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_MAX_RECEIVERS
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	int "Maximum number of receive filters per device"
	default 16
	help

	The driver maintains a receive filter list per device for fast access.

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_BUS_ERR
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	bool
	default n
	help

	To avoid unnecessary bus error interrupt flooding, this option enables
	bus error interrupts when an application is calling a receive function
	on a socket listening on bus errors. After one bus error has occured,
	the interrupt will be disabled to allow the application time for error
	processing. This option is automatically selected for CAN controllers
	supporting bus error interrupts like the SJA1000.

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_CALC_BITTIME_OLD
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	bool "Old bit-time calculation algorithm (deprecated)"
	default n
	help

	This option allows to enable the old algorithm to calculate the
	CAN bit-timing parameters for backward compatibility.

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_VIRT
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN
	tristate "Virtual CAN bus driver"
	help

	This driver provides two CAN ports that are virtually interconnected.
	More ports can be enabled with the module parameter "devices".

config XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_FLEXCAN
	depends on XENO_DRIVERS_CAN && OF && !XENO_DRIVERS_CAN_CALC_BITTIME_OLD
	tristate "Freescale FLEXCAN based chips"
	help

	Say Y here if you want to support for Freescale FlexCAN.
