    default y
    ---help---
    Enables real-time packet sockets for RTnet. This support is
    implemented in a separate module. When loaded, application programs
    can send and received so-called "cooked" packets directly at OSI layer
    2 (device layer). This means that RTnet will still maintain the
    device-dependent packet header but leave the full data segment to the
    user.

    Examples like raw-ethernet or netshm make use of this support. See
    also Linux man page packet(7).
