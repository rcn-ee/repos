config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET
    tristate "Real-Time IPv4"
    default y
    ---help---
    Enables the real-time capable IPv4 support of RTnet. The protocol is
    implemented as a separate module. Supplementing tools (rtroute,
    rtping) and examples are provided as well. Moreover, RTcfg will
    include IPv4 support when this option is switched on.

    For further information see also Documentation/README.routing and
    Documentation/README.ipfragmentation.

config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_ICMP
    bool "ICMP support"
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4
    default y
    ---help---
    Enables ICMP support of the RTnet Real-Time IPv4 protocol.

    When the RTnet-Proxy is enabled while this feature is disabled, ICMP
    will be forwarded to the Linux network stack.

config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_HOST_ROUTES
    int "Maximum host routing table entries"
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4
    default 32
    ---help---
    Each IPv4 supporting interface and each remote host that is directly
    reachable via via some output interface requires a host routing table
    entry. If you run larger networks with may hosts per subnet, you may
    have to increase this limit. Must be power of 2!

config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_NETROUTING
    bool "IP Network Routing"
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4
    ---help---
    Enables routing across IPv4 real-time networks. You will only require
    this feature in complex networks, while switching it off for flat,
    single-segment networks improves code size and the worst-case routing
    decision delay.

    See Documentation/README.routing for further information.

config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_NET_ROUTES
    int "Maximum network routing table entries"
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_NETROUTING
    default 16
    ---help---
    Each route describing a target network reachable via a router
    requires an entry in the network routing table. If you run very
    complex realtime networks, you may have to increase this limit. Must
    be power of 2!

config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_ROUTER
    bool "IP Router"
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4
    ---help---
    When switched on, the RTnet station will be able to forward IPv4
    packets that are not directed to the station itself. Typically used in
    combination with CONFIG_RTNET_RTIPV4_NETROUTING.

    See Documentation/README.routing for further information.

config XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4_DEBUG
    bool "RTipv4 Debugging"
    depends on XENO_DRIVERS_NET_RTIPV4
    default n
    
    ---help---
    Enables debug message output of the RTipv4 layer. Typically, you
    may want to turn this on for tracing issues in packet delivery.
