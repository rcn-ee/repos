RT-Socket-CAN - RTDM driver for CAN devices
===========================================

RT-Socket-CAN is an Open Source hard real-time protocol stack for CAN 
devices based on BSD sockets. This implementation is for RTDM, the 
Real-Time-Driver-Model. Note that there is a similar variant being 
developed for standard Linux using the Linux networking stack.


Status:
------

Currently drivers are available for the following CAN controllers and 
devices:

   SJA1000 ISA devices
   SJA1000 Memory-mapped devices
   SJA1000 esd EPPC405 embedded controller and CPCI405 boards
   SJA1000 PEAK PCI card
   SJA1000 PEAK parallel port Dongle
   SJA1000 IXXAT PCI card
   MSCAN for MPC5200 boards

Utilities for RT-Socket-CAN are available in "src/utils/can".


Installation:
------------

This example installation is for the DENX "linuxppc_2_4_devel" tree
(Linux 2.4.25) using the ELDK (see http://www.denx.de). It works in a
similar way for other kernels and distributions including Linux 2.6.


o Kernel space part:

  - Please install the Xenomai kernel space part as described in the
    README.INSTALL.

  - Configure RT-Socket-CAN as kernel modules as required by your 
    hardware (and make sure that loadable module support is enabled):

    $ cd <linux-kernel-root>
    $ export CROSS_COMPILE=ppc_82xx-
    $ make menuconfig
    ... Select "Loadable module support  --->" 
    [*] Enable loadable module support 
    ... Exit
    ... Select "Real-time sub-system --->"
               "Real-time drivers --->" 
                 "CAN bus controller --->"
    [M] RT-Socket-CAN, CAN raw socket interface (NEW)
    (1024) Size of receive ring buffers (must be 2^N) (NEW)
    (4) Maximum number of devices (NEW)
    (16) Maximum number of receive filters per device (NEW)
    [M] MSCAN driver for MPC5200 (NEW)
    [*] Enable CAN 1 (NEW)
    [*] Enable CAN 2 (NEW)
    (66000000) Clock Frequency in Hz (NEW)
    (I2C1/TMR01) Pin Configuration
    <M> Philips SJA1000 CAN controller (NEW)
    <M>   Standard ISA devices
    (4)   Maximum number of ISA devices (NEW)
    <M>   PEAK PCI cards
    ... Exit and save

    Note: you can also statically link the MSCAN drivers into 
    the kernel.


  - Make the Linux kernel and RT-Socket-CAN modules and copy them to 
    the root filesystem:

    $ make dep
    $ make uImage
    $ cp -p arch/ppc/boot/images/uImage /tftpboot/icecube/uImage-rtcan
    $ make modules
    $ export DESTDIR=/opt/eldk/ppc_82xx
    $ make modules_install INSTALL_MOD_PATH=$DESTDIR
    $ find $DESTDIR/lib/modules/2.4.25/kernel/drivers/xenomai/rtcan
    .../rtcan
    .../rtcan/xeno_can.o
    .../rtcan/mscan
    .../rtcan/mscan/xeno_can_mscan.o
    .../rtcan/sja1000/xeno_can_sja1000.o
    .../rtcan/sja1000/xeno_can_peak_pci.o
    .../rtcan/sja1000/xeno_can_isa.o

  - Loading the RT-Socket-CAN modules

    Now boot the Xenomai enabled kernel on your target system.

    In case RT-Socket-CAN is built as kernel modules, you need to load 
    them using modprobe or insmod, e.g. for this example build:

    # export MODDIR=/lib/modules/2.4.25/kernel/drivers/xenomai/rtcan
    # insmod $MODDIR/xeno_can.o
    # insmod $MODDIR/mscan/xeno_can_mscan.o
    # insmod $MODDIR/sja1000/xeno_can_sja1000.o
    # insmod $MODDIR/sja1000/xeno_can_peak_pci.o

    Note that various kernel module parameters can be passed with 
    insmod. Please use "modinfo" to list them or check the 
    corresponding source code files for further information.


o User space part:

  - User space CAN utilities for RT-Socket-CAN are available in
    "src/utils/can". Please check the README in there for further 
    information.
